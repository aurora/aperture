<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>Goals of the Project</h2>

<p>
Aperture is an open source library and framework for crawling and indexing information
sources such as file systems, websites and mail boxes. Aperture supports a number of
common source types and document formats out-of-the-box and provides easy ways to extend
it with custom implementations.
</p>

<p>
The Aperture code consists of a number of related but independently usable parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Crawling of information sources: file systems, websites, mail boxes</li>

<li>MIME type identification</li>

<li>Full-text and metadata extraction of various file formats</li>

<li>Expansion of archives (to be done)</li>

<li>Indexing and querying of crawled and extracted information (to be done)</li>

<li>Opening of crawled resources (to be done)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each of these parts, a set of APIs has been developed and a number of implementations
is provided.
</p>

<p>
Aperture has a strong focus on semantics. For example, a lot of effort is made in order
to let the Extractors also extract as much metadata contained in the file formats as
possible (e.g., titles, authors, comments, ...) and combine this with source-specific
metadata (e.g., location, last modification date, ...). All metadata is mapped to
properties in a global Aperture namespace to allow uniform processing of the crawled
and extracted information.
</p>

<p>
Although the way in which the information is indexed and queried can entirely be decided
by the integrator, Aperture offers powerful ways to index it in a semantically rich and
extensible way, using RDF(S)-based indexing mechanisms. This allows for querying using
Semantic Web query languages such as SPARQL and SeRQL.
</p>

<h2>Historic Background</h2>

<p>
Aperture started as a cooperation between the German DFKI institute
(<a href="http://www.dfki.de/">http://www.dfki.de</a>) and the Dutch software firm Aduna
(<a href="http://aduna.biz/">http://aduna.biz</a>).
</p>

<p>
Both organizations had already produced software sharing certain characteristics, such as
targeting desktop search using Semantic Web technology. Therefore, they necessarily had to
solve the same technical problems, like incremental crawling of a file system, text and
metadata extraction and indexing and querying of metadata.
</p>

<p>
This made them realize that through cooperation on these issues they could get better
code at lower individual efforts. Furthermore, this would enable other people to contribute
as well.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 2005 they decided to start a joint open source project that would be
bootstrapped with the crawling and indexing code already developed in-house and that
would serve as a basis for future development.
</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>
The Aperture code is published under an open source license
(<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/afl-3.0.php">AFL 3.0</a> for APIs and example
code, <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-3.0.php">OSL 3.0</a> for API implementations)
that allows the use of Aperture in proprietary applications.
</p>

<p>
In short, in order to use Aperture your own code does not have to be open source, with one
exception: if you create a modified version of an Aperture API implementation (i.e., you
base it on a file published under the OSL license), then you are required to publish that
part under the same license.
</p>

<p>
For example, when you create an improved version of the Excel text and metadata extractor
using the Aperture implementation as a starting point, then this derivative code must also be
distributed under the OSL. Your own implementations of Aperture APIs are not required to
be open sourced, nor is any code using Aperture components.
