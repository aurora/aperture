<h3>Third party libs</h3>
<p>
Licenses for third party libraries used in Aperture can be found in ./lib/

</p>

<p>
The use of BSD in the core framework allows developers to license
implementations of Aperture APIs under any license they see fit,
including proprietary and commercial licenses.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
The aperture framework is free to use
and to extend. 
Through use of BSD, we experience that the framework is more useful
and users are willing to contribute to the project.
