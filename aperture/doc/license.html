<h1>Aperture License</h1>

<p><i>The current Aperture licensing has been decided on in November 2008, after 
the release of Aperture 1.2.0. At the moment (as of 28.11.2008) it applies to 
the source code in our subversion repository. No releases under this license 
have been made yet. For information on the previous license (applicable to all 
releases up to 1.2.0) please see <a href="#oldlicense">below</a></i></p>

<p>
The Aperture Framework itself is distributed under a 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD-style license</a>.
The copyright holder for each particular source file is given within the

<h3>Third party libs</h3>
<p>
Licenses for third party libraries used in Aperture can be found in ./lib/

</p>

<p>
The use of BSD in the core framework allows developers to license
implementations of Aperture APIs under any license they see fit,
including proprietary and commercial licenses.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
The aperture framework is free to use
and to extend. 
Through use of BSD, we experience that the framework is more useful
and users are willing to contribute to the project.
</p>

<a name="oldlicense"><h2>Previous Aperture License (releases up to 1.2.0)</h2></a>


<p>
The core project APIs and architecture are licensed under the
Academic Free License (AFL) version 3.0. <a href="license_AFL3.0.html">(AFL 3.0)</a>
<a href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/AFL3.0.htm">(original source)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The implementations of these APIs are licensed under the Open
Software License (OSL) version 3.0. <a href="license_OSL3.0.html">(OSL 3.0)</a>
<a href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0.htm">(original source)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The use of these two licenses allows developers to license
implementations of Aperture APIs under any license they see fit,
including proprietary and commercial licenses.
</p>

<p>
The API implementations contained in Aperture are licensed under the OSL,
which is a reciprocal license. This effectively means that <em>changes</em> to these
implementations have to be made available to the community, while these
implementations and their derivatives can be <em>used</em> in applications licensed
under a different license.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
The core parts (APIs and closely associated classes) are free to use
and to extend. They should be as open as possible so that anyone can
include Aperture in a project, commercial, closed source or not.
Especially, people should not be required (or even think they are
required) to disclose their own implementations for accessing
proprietary document formats, data sources, etc., as these may
necessarily contain trade secrets, require patent licenses, etc.
</p>

<p>
Besides a framework, Aperture contains a number of concrete implementations, e.g.
Crawlers for various information sources and Extractors for various document types.
A lot of time and effort has been put in
their creation and maintenance and they are therefore licensed under a
reciprocal license. This means that changes to this code such as
functional extentions, bugfixes and performance improvements, that are
redistributed or externally deployed in one way or another, have to be made available to
the community under the same open source license. However, this restriction has
no effect on the code using these standard and derived implementations, so your
own applications are never at risk.
