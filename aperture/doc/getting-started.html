<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>
To obtain Aperture, you can download the latest release at SourceForge.net or checkout
and compile the latest version directly from CVS. While the project is still in alpha stage, the
latter will most likely give you the best code to work with.
</p>

<h2>Download the latest release</h2>

<p>
The latest Aperture release can be downloaded at
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=150969">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=150969</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unzip the zip or tar.gz file to a location of your choice and open the created folder.
</p>

<p>
The lib directory contains the Aperture jar files as well as third-party jar files and
their licenses.
</p>

<p>
For running Aperture you will at least need aperture-&lt;version&gt;.jar.
The aperture- examples-&lt;version&gt;.jar file is only needed when using the Aperture example classes.
The aperture-test-&lt;version&gt;.jar file is normally not needed. You will also need the
openrdf-model and openrdf-util jar files, as they are used by the Aperture APIs.
</p>

<p>
Most other jar files are used by Extractor and Crawler implementations. If you don't use
them, you will probably not need them.
</p>

<p>
The src.zip file contains all Aperture source code, including examples and JUnit tests.
</p>

<p>
The bin directory contains batch files and shell scripts for starting the GUI versions of
the examples. These include a file system crawler, an IMAP mail folder crawler and a
file inspector, showing you the output of Aperture's MIME type identification and full-text and
metadata extraction.
</p>

<p>
Note that there are also various commandline examples whose code is a lot simpler to understand.
</p>

<p>
The minimum Java version to run Aperture is Java 1.4.2, but it runs fine with Java 5 and 6 as well.
</p>

<h2>Checkout from CVS</h2>

<p>
First, you should read
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=150969">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=150969</a>
about getting the latest Aperture sources from CVS.
</p>

<p>
Once checked out, you can use the Ant build script in Aperture's root directory to build
the project. Notable targets are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>compile: compiles all classes, excluding unit tests and example classes (use
compile.examples and compile.test for that).</li>
<li>jar: creates the core Aperture jar file (likewise, use jar.examples and jar.test for
the other two).</li>
<li>dist: creates and gathers all jar files and javadocs in build/dist. All unit tests
are also applied.</li>
<li>release: combines the dist results with all other required files (scripts, licenses,
...) and puts them in build/release.</li>
<li>package: creates .zip and .tar.gz files of the release results (used to created the
dowloadable releases).</li>
<li>test: run all JUnit tests.</li>
<li>clean: removes all generated files.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The minimum Java version to run Aperture is Java 1.4.2, but it runs fine with Java 5 and 6 as well.
</p>

<p>
The precise minimum Ant requirements are currently unknown; the build files have been tested with
Ant 1.6.5, older versions may or may not work.
