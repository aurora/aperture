<h1>DataSources</h1>

<p>
One of the central concepts of Aperture is the notion of a DataSource.
A DataSource contains all information necessary to locate the individual information resources in a
physical source. For example, a FileSystemDataSource holds a root directory, a set of patterns that describe
what files to include or exclude, a maximum depth, etc., thereby effectively describing a set of files.

<p>
One of the main purposes of a DataSource is to hold all data needed by a <a href="crawlers.html">Crawler</a>
to crawl the physical source and retrieve all the individual resources in it.
</p>

<p>
The current data source hierarchy looks as follows:
</p>

<p>
The specific DataSource implementations available at the moment do nothing more than define a
URI used to identify the data source type in a RDF model. That's why you don't need to explicitly
add the RDF.type - source:FileSystemDataSource property.
</p>

<p>
All configuration data is modeled as an RDF model and
stored in a RDFContainer. Whenever possible, properties from the SourceVocabulary are used
to model configuration settings, Although developers of new DataSource types are free to use
their own properties when necessary. 
The configuration RDFContainer is the intended place to store the configuration data. That's why the classes
don't contain any additional fields. Such additional fields should be added only if there is no possibility
to represent the needed information in RDF.
Once we start to use a DataSource whose configuration cannot entirely be expressed in an RDF
model, we can use its DataSource implementation class to hold the remaining configuration.
</p>

<p>

A utility class, ConfigurationUtil, is provided that contains method for editing and
retrieving configuration data from the RDFContainer. Note that it only knows how to deal with
configuration properties defined in the SourceVocabulary interface. 
</p>

<p>
It is worth mentioning, that DataSource classes only DESCRIBE a data source. They don't contain any resources
that would enable direct access to the source (such as InputStreams, or Readers, whatever...). (At least
it was not the intention of the designers). Any such resource may be encapsulated in a DataObject returned
by an Accessor.
</p>

<p>
The following code demonstrates how to create and configure a FileSystemDataSource:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<font color="#0000ff">// determine the root folder of the source</font>
File rootFolder = <font color="#804040"><b>new</b></font> File(<font color="#ff00ff">&quot;D:</font><font color="#6a5acd">\\</font><font color="#ff00ff">path</font><font color="#6a5acd">\\</font><font color="#ff00ff">to</font><font color="#6a5acd">\\</font><font color="#ff00ff">the</font><font color="#6a5acd">\\</font><font color="#ff00ff">root</font><font color="#6a5acd">\\</font><font color="#ff00ff">folder&quot;</font>);

<font color="#0000ff">// determine a URI to identify the DataSource</font>
URI id = <font color="#804040"><b>new</b></font> URIImpl(<font color="#ff00ff">&quot;urn:test:testsource&quot;</font>);

<font color="#0000ff">// create the DataSource configuration</font>
Model model = RDF2Go.getModelFactory().createModel();
RDFContainer configuration = <font color="#804040"><b>new</b></font> RDFContainerImpl(model,id);
ConfigurationUtil.setRootFolder(rootFolder.getAbsolutePath(), configuration);

<font color="#0000ff">// create the DataSource instance</font>
FileSystemDataSource source = <font color="#804040"><b>new</b></font> FileSystemDataSource();
source.setConfiguration(configuration)
</pre>
