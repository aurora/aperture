<h1>MIME Type Identification</h1>

<p>
One of the core tasks of Aperture is full-text and metadata extraction.
To choose the right Extractor for a given document, one must first establish the document's
MIME type. Therefore, we have designed a MimeTypeIdentifier API that fulfills this task
and developed a general purpose implementation for it, MagicMimeTypeIdentifier.
</p>

<p>
We know from experience that simple heuristics based on for example file name extensions
or HTTP result headers break rather easily.
Our implementation is therefore primarily based on magic numbers (the first few bytes
in a file that often identify the MIME type with great accuracy) and use file
extensions only as a fall-back when a certain document type does not have
a magic number (e.g. BinHex files) or when the magic number is shared by a number of different
formats (e.g. all MS Office files and some other file formats all have the same magic number).
</p>

<p>
The MIME types and their magic numbers and extensions are described in an XML file delivered
with the MagicMimeTypeIdentifier. The XML file to use can be specified though, so the
same code can also be used with a different set of MIME type descriptions.
The format of the XML file and the algorithm for applying them is documented in the
default descriptions XML file.

See the page on <a href="extractors.html">Extractors</a> for a combined example of how to
use a MimeTypeIdentifier and the Extractor framework.
