<h1>MIME Type Identification</h1>

one of core tasks of Aperture is full-text and metadata extraction.
this relies heavily on knowing the correct MIME type of a document.
Simple heuristics based on file name extension or HTTP result headers break easily.

therefore, developed a MimeTypeIdentifier service
single implementation available, based on magic numbers and file extensions
magic numbers overrule all.
file extensions are used as fallback when a certain document type does not have
a magic number (e.g. ...) or when the magic number is shared by a number of different
formats (all MS Office files share the same magic number)

magic numbers are defined in an XML file: same implementation can be used with
a custom descriptions file. FIXME: files is currently fixed.

example code:
initialize a MagicMimeTypeIdentifier
inspect a given document
