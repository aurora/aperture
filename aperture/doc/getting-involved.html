<h1>Getting Involved</h1>

<p>
Have questions? Found bugs? Created a new implementation or improved an existing one?
Want to know about future plans?
</p>

<p>
The first place to ask around is the Aperture developers mailing list:

</p>

<p>
Currently, there is no separate users mailing list but you're welcome to ask Aperture usage questions
on the developers mailing list for now.
</p>

<p>
We are constantly trying to improve and expand our set of supported data sources and file formats.
If you have created an Extractor or Crawler implementation that would
be interesting for us to include or have created an improvement of an existing
implementation, please contact us on this mailing list.
