<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
<b>What source types does Aperture support?</b><br>
Currently Aperture can crawl file systems (including shared network drives
and removeable media), websites and IMAP mail boxes. An Outlook crawler is in the works.
</p>

<p>
<b>Which file formats does Aperture support?</b><br>
See the page on <a href="tutorial/extractors.html">Extractors</a> for a list of
file formats, their dependencies and remarks regarding their quality.
</p>

<p>
<b>What is the minimum required Java version?</b><br>
Aperture's APIs are all compatible with Java 1.4.2, i.e. no generics or other Java 5 language features
are used. Some API implementations may require Java 5 though, so when you are using Aperture with all
its implementations, Java 5 is the minimum required version. Aperture runs fine with Java 6 (at the time
of writing still in beta) as well.
