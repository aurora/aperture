A brief explanation of the jars in this directory is on the wiki page 

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/Dependencies

So. whenever you change anything in the lib folder do as follows:
1. Insert the new jar file
2. Delete the old one (if necessary)
3. Make sure that you have the license file
4. Update the selectors in selectors.xml
5. If necessary update the osgirelease target in build 'xml'
6. Update the Bundle-Classpath entries in the manifests 
7. If the jar is not one released by someone else and you made any changes to it
   document the patches in the patches folder
8. Update the dependencies wiki page
   the source of the jar
   the license
   what project it is
   what changes have been made and why
   what components depend on it
