Aperture is a Java framework for extracting and querying full-text content
and metadata from various information systems (file systems, web sites, mail
boxes, ...) and the file formats (documents, images, ...) occurring in these
systems.

*) To use Aperture in your own application:

Add lib/aperture-<version>.jar and all non-Aperture jar files in the same
directory to your classpath.
  
The aperture-examples-<version.jar> and aperture-test-<version>.jar are
not needed to use the core functionality.
  
The junit jar file is only needed when you want to run unit tests
("ant test").
  
Finally, read doc/documentation.html for instructions on how to use the
provided APIs.

*) To create your own jar files:

Install Java 1.4 or higher and Ant 1.6.x or higher.

Unzip the src.zip in the Aperture root directory (i.e. where this file is
located). This should result in an src directory and a build.xml file.

Type "ant build" to only compile the source files, "ant dist" to create jar
files, "ant release" to create an entire Aperture release or "ant package"
to create zip and tar.gz files containing an entire Aperture release.

"ant test" will run all unit tests. "ant javadoc" will create javadoc
documentation.

*) To contribute your own implementations of Aperture APIs:
