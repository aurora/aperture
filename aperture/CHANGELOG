----------------------------------
version 2005.1-alpha-1, 2005-11-10
----------------------------------

- First public release of the source code.

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-alpha-2, 2006-03-06
----------------------------------

This releases adds a lot of crucial implementations and fixes
to the previous release, which was mainly focused on establishing a
number of core APIs. The latest release can be seen as the first release
for practical, real world use.

Due to the large number of changes and additions, we only list the most
important functional changes:

- Revised the RDFContainer interface and implementation.

- Extended the number of Extractor implementations from 4 to 17, which
  adds support for the various MS Office file formats as well as a number of
  other formats.

- Added the DataSource API and utility classes for configuring them.

- Added the DataAccessor API and associated DataObject interfaces for
  accessing individual resources, with implementations for the "file",
  "http", "imap" and "outlook" schemes.
  
- Added the Crawler API with implementations for file system crawling,
  web crawling, IMAP crawling (all stable) and Outlook crawling (alpha).

- added the LinkExtractor API with an implementation for HTML documents,
  primarily meant to facilitate web crawling.

- Added classes for dealing with non-validatable certificates when using
  a SSL connection.

- Considerably extended documentation and example code.

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-alpha-3, 2006-11-02
----------------------------------

The most notable feature of this release is the IcalCrawler. It can crawl
files in the popular iCalendar format. Many calendaring applications use
this format either natively, or via some export/import functionality. It
uses the rdf-mapping developed by the w3c Rdf Calendaring group. (With some
improvements - see javadoc). Additional improvements include: 

- added MIME type detection for many formats:

- improved MIME type detection of MHTML files (web archives)

- introduced HtmlParserUtil, containing large parts of the HtmlExtractor
  implementation, as HTML (fragments) may occur in other document types as
  well (e.g. saved mails, see MimeExtractor)

- the maximumSize property is now a long instead of an int

- added ThreadedExtractorWrapper class, for catching and interrupting hanging
  Extractors

- added RepositoryAccessData, an AccessData implementation storing its
  information in a Repository

- added ability to specify a port number for an IMAP source

- set target platform to Java 5

updated dependencies:
- HTMLParser 1.6
- Ical (from trunk, not the official release)
- JavaMail 1.4
- POI 3.0 alpha 2
- PDFBox 0.7.3 (+ added FontBox, bcmail and bcprov, now required by PDFBox)

bug fixes:
- [ 1444917 ] PlainTextExtractor ignores ByteOrderMarks
- [ 1444926 ] MagicMimeTypeIdentifier cannot handle text files with BOMs
- [ 1445519 ] mails in non-western languages
- [ 1445641 ] MimeExtractors cannot process MHTML files
- [ 1445658 ] MimeExtractor should process HTML body parts
- [ 1476150 ] ImapCrawler.getDataObject attempts to access a closed folder
- [ 1480416 ] IOExceptions using ImapCrawler.getDataObject output
- [ 1481111 ] XmlExtractor needs improved DTD handling
- [ 1481132 ] OpenDocumentExtractor unable to load DTDs from jar files
- [ 1481759 ] Unable to use IMAP over SSL with JavaMail 1.4
- [ 1558484 ] HttpAccessor should use timeouts on connection
- [ 1567288 ] Incorrect link data by WebCrawler
- many bugfixes in ImapCrawler's incremental crawling
- same for WebCrawler and HttpAccessor
- prevent NullPointerException in FileDataObjectBase.dispose
- made sure ThreadedExtractorWrapper redirects all Exceptions of the wrapped Extractor

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-alpha-4
----------------------------------

The entire Aperture Framework has been rewritten to utilize the RDF2Go framework.
It is now completely independent from the underlying RDF store. Aperture registries
and factories can now be used in an OSGi environment as services. The 
infrastructure allows for on-the-fly deployment of new extraction components. 

Additional improvements include:

- the logging subsystem has been changed from Java Util Logging to SLF4J. This solves
some classloading issues that were encountered when using Aperture in 
web applications.

- a set of OSGI BundleActivators have been added for embedding Aperture
in an OSGi environment. Additional ant target creates two OSGI bundles from 
Aperture source code. The OSGi setup has been tested extensively
in the Nepomuk Social Semantic Desktop project.

Updated dependencies
- updated Sesame 2.0 from alpha-3 to beta-4
- updated the applewrapper library to version 0.2
- RDF2Go 4.4.1
- Sesame 2.0-beta4 RDF2Go Adapter revision 2682
- SLF4J 1.3.0
- osgi.core-4.0.jar - The reference OSGI jar file, necessary to compile activators.
- don't use apache commons-logging anymore, the RDF2Go depends on commons-logging
  but this is now done with the jcl104-over-slf4j bridge
- removed the original commons-codec.jar and replaced with an OSGI-friendly
  bundle org.apache.commons.codec_1.2.0.jar
- org.apache.httpclient_3.0.0.rc2.jar  

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-beta-1 
----------------------------------

This release bears the mark of the Nepomuk Social Semantic Desktop - a major
research initative where research institutes and commercial companies
from around Europe. Aperture is used as one of the pillars of a next-generation 
platform that will revolutionize the way people organize and use
the data stored on their computers. The input from the Nepomuk Community drove
us to implement a host of new features that make Aperture more useful, more 
flexible and more powerful.

New Features
 
- Aperture has been migrated to use the newly developed Nepomuk
  Information Element Ontology framework. This added a new level of precision
  and expressiveness for the output of Aperture components. All components have 
  benefitted from this change. The output is now thoroughly tested with an 
  extensible rdf validator for compliance with the ontology. The ontology itself 
  is endorsed by the Nepomuk Consortium, well documented and maintained.

Additional improvements
- the data source configuration API has been overhauled and is now much more 
intuitive.
- New JpgExtractor

Updated dependencies
- Sesame 2.0 beta-6 (was beta-4)
- RDF2Go 4.4.6
- Sesame
