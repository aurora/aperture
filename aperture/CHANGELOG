version 2006.1-alpha-2, 2006-03-06
----------------------------------

This releases adds a lot of crucial implementations and fixes
to the previous release, which was mainly focused on establishing a
number of core APIs. The latest release can be seen as the first release
for practical, real world use.

Due to the large number of changes and additions, we only list the most
important functional changes:

- Revised the RDFContainer interface and implementation.

- Extended the number of Extractor implementations from 4 to 17, which
  adds support for the various MS Office file formats as well as a number of
  other formats.

- Added the DataSource API and utility classes for configuring them.

- Added the DataAccessor API and associated DataObject interfaces for
  accessing individual resources, with implementations for the "file",
  "http", "imap" and "outlook" schemes.
  
- Added the Crawler API with implementations for file system crawling,
  web crawling, IMAP crawling (all stable) and Outlook crawling (alpha).

- added the LinkExtractor API with an implementation for HTML documents,
  primarily meant to facilitate web crawling.

- Added classes for dealing with non-validatable certificates when using
  a SSL connection.

- Considerably extended documentation and example code.
