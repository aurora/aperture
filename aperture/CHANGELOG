----------------------------------
version 2005.1-alpha-1, 2005-11-10
----------------------------------

- First public release of the source code.

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-alpha-2, 2006-03-06
----------------------------------

This releases adds a lot of crucial implementations and fixes
to the previous release, which was mainly focused on establishing a
number of core APIs. The latest release can be seen as the first release
for practical, real world use.

Due to the large number of changes and additions, we only list the most
important functional changes:

- Revised the RDFContainer interface and implementation.

- Extended the number of Extractor implementations from 4 to 17, which
  adds support for the various MS Office file formats as well as a number of
  other formats.

- Added the DataSource API and utility classes for configuring them.

- Added the DataAccessor API and associated DataObject interfaces for
  accessing individual resources, with implementations for the "file",
  "http", "imap" and "outlook" schemes.
  
- Added the Crawler API with implementations for file system crawling,
  web crawling, IMAP crawling (all stable) and Outlook crawling (alpha).

- added the LinkExtractor API with an implementation for HTML documents,
  primarily meant to facilitate web crawling.

- Added classes for dealing with non-validatable certificates when using
  a SSL connection.

- Considerably extended documentation and example code.

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-alpha-3, 2006-11-02
----------------------------------

The most notable feature of this release is the IcalCrawler. It can crawl
files in the popular iCalendar format. Many calendaring applications use
this format either natively, or via some export/import functionality. It
uses the rdf-mapping developed by the w3c Rdf Calendaring group. (With some
improvements - see javadoc). Additional improvements include: 

- added MIME type detection for many formats:

- improved MIME type detection of MHTML files (web archives)

- introduced HtmlParserUtil, containing large parts of the HtmlExtractor
  implementation, as HTML (fragments) may occur in other document types as
  well (e.g. saved mails, see MimeExtractor)

- the maximumSize property is now a long instead of an int

- added ThreadedExtractorWrapper class, for catching and interrupting hanging
  Extractors

- added RepositoryAccessData, an AccessData implementation storing its
  information in a Repository

- added ability to specify a port number for an IMAP source

- set target platform to Java 5

updated dependencies:
- HTMLParser 1.6
- Ical (from trunk, not the official release)
- JavaMail 1.4
- POI 3.0 alpha 2
- PDFBox 0.7.3 (+ added FontBox, bcmail and bcprov, now required by PDFBox)

- [ 1444917 ] PlainTextExtractor ignores ByteOrderMarks
- [ 1444926 ] MagicMimeTypeIdentifier cannot handle text files with BOMs
- [ 1445519 ] mails in non-western languages

- made sure ThreadedExtractorWrapper redirects all Exceptions of the wrapped Extractor

----------------------------------
version 2006.1-alpha-4 31.05.2007
----------------------------------

The entire Aperture Framework has been rewritten to utilize the RDF2Go framework.
It is now completely independent from the underlying RDF store. Aperture registries
and factories can now be used in an OSGi environment as services. The 
infrastructure allows for on-the-fly deployment of new extraction components. 

Additional improvements include:

- the logging subsystem has been changed from Java Util Logging to SLF4J. This solves
some classloading issues that were encountered when using Aperture in 
web applications.

- a set of OSGI BundleActivators have been added for embedding Aperture
in an OSGi environment. Additional ant target creates two OSGI bundles from 
Aperture source code. The OSGi setup has been tested extensively
in the Nepomuk Social Semantic Desktop project.

Updated dependencies
- updated Sesame 2.0 from alpha-3 to beta-4
- updated the applewrapper library to version 0.2
- RDF2Go 4.4.1
- Sesame 2.0-beta4 RDF2Go Adapter revision 2682
- SLF4J 1.3.0
- osgi.core-4.0.jar - The reference OSGI jar file, necessary to compile activators.
- don't use apache commons-logging anymore, the RDF2Go depends on commons-logging
  but this is now done with the jcl104-over-slf4j bridge
- removed the original commons-codec.jar and replaced with an OSGI-friendly
  bundle org.apache.commons.codec_1.2.0.jar
- org.apache.httpclient_3.0.0.rc2.jar  

----------------------------------
version 1.0.1-beta   12.11.2007
----------------------------------


This release bears the mark of the Nepomuk Social Semantic
Desktop - a major intiative combining research 
institutes and commercial companies from around Europe. 
Aperture is used as one of the pillars of a 
next-generation  platform that changes the way 
people can organize and use the data stored on their 
computers. The input from the Nepomuk Community drove us to 
implement a host of new features that make Aperture more 
useful, more flexible and more powerful.

New Features
 
- Aperture has been migrated to use the newly developed
  Nepomuk Information Element Ontology framework. This 
  added a new level of precision and expressiveness to the
  output of Aperture components. The ontology itself 
  is endorsed by the Nepomuk Consortium, well documented 
  and maintained.
- The output is now thoroughly tested with an extensible 
  rdf validator for compliance with the ontology. This 
  allowed us to fix a number of bugs that made certain 
  properties appear in places they didn't belong
- the data source configuration API has been overhauled and 
  is now much more easy to use
- A new facility that allows clients to implement dynamic 
  GUIs for data source configuration.
- New JpgExtractor that extracts EXIF annotations from JPG 
  files
- four new experimental crawlers (Flickr, Bibsonomy, 
  del.icio.us and Apple IPhoto).
- host of small improvements and bug fixes

Updated dependencies
- Sesame 2.0 beta-6 (was beta-4)
- RDF2Go 4.4.6
- RDF2Go driver for sesame
- A metadata-extractor-2.4.0-beta-1 library used by the  
  JPGExtractor
- POI has been update to 3.0-FINAL
- flickrapi-1.0b4 used by the FlickrCrawler
- DFKIUtils 2.0 some XML-related utilities are used by the 
  website crawlers
- nrlvalidator-0.1 the validator used by the unit tests
- infsail-0.1 and unionsail-0.1 dependencies of the 
  validator
  
----------------------------------
version 1.1.0.beta 17.05.2008
----------------------------------

This release aims to reduce the memory footprint and increase the range of data
sources explorable by Aperture. It adds support for MP3 files, vcards and mbox
mailboxes. The Architecture has been extended with the concept of a SubCrawler,
that can crawl DataObjects returned by other crawlers thus opening possibilities
for the development of new, even better exploration components.

New features
- a redesigned AccessData interface which fulfils two goals
  - correct handling of data objects embedded in other data objects (SubCrawlers)
  - no need to store large sets in memory (deprecatedUrls and crawledUrls)
- new SubCrawler interface, with associated infrastructure
- the SubCrawler interface comes with a first implementation: the VcardSubCrawler
  for crawling vcard files, each may potentially contain many vcards
- the FileExtractor interface - extracts information from formats which are 
  ill-suited for stream-based processing
- the first implementation of FileExtractor - the MP3FileExtractor, does what
  you think it does, extracts ID3 information from MP3 files supports both
  ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags
- added workaround to load UTF-7 charset when in OSGi in MailUtil
- fixed Outlook nullpointerexceptions introduced in last release
- host of smaller improvements and bugfixes

Updated Dependencies
- OSGi bundles now also use aperture version numbers
- updated pdfbox to unreleased 0.7.4 version fixing parsing errors,
  includes update for fontbox
- flickrapi updated to 1.0 final
- ical4j updated to 1.0-beta4
