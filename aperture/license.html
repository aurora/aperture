<h1>Policy</h1>
<p>
The core parts (APIs and closely associated classes) are free to use
and to extend. They should be as open as possible so that anyone can
include Aperture in a project, commercial, closed source or not.
Especially, people should not be required (or even think they are
required) to disclose their own implementations for accessing
proprietary document formats, data sources, etc.
</p>
<p>
Besides a framework, Aperture contains a number of concrete adapter and
extractor implementations. A lot of time and effort has been put in
their creation and maintenance and they are therefore licensed under a
reciprocal license, meaning that changes to this code, such as
functional extentions, bugfixes, performance improvements, that are
redistributed in one way or another way, have to be made available to
the community under the same open source license.
</p>
<h1>License</h1>
<p>
The core project interfaces and architecture are published using the
Academic Free License (AFL) in the latest version 3.0. <a
 href="license_AFL3.0.html">(AFL 3.0)</a> <a
 href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/AFL3.0.htm">(original source)</a>
</p>
<p>
The implementations of datasources and extractors are licensed under
the Open
Software License (OSL) in the latest version 3.0. <a
 href="license_OSL3.0.html">(OSL 3.0)</a> <a
 href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0.htm">(original source)</a>
</p>
<p>
The use of these two licenses allows developers to implement
datasource/extractor implementations under any license they want. The
public implementations of Aperture are under the OSL, which is a
Reciprocal license, meaning that changes to the DataSource
implementations are returned back to the community. </p>
