<h1>Microsoft Outlook Crawler</h2>
<p>This package holds a crawler for Microsoft Outlook. It extracts the information from Outlook and 
represents it using our Data-Schema plus ICAL and VCARD as RDF. To use the Crawler, you have to:
<ul>
  <li>Have Outlook installed. We do not read the binary files</li>
  <li>Have the Jacob.dll in your exe's path</li>
  <li>Bonus: Have Outlook Redemption installed. If not, more bug messages will bug you. 
  	See <a href="http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/">dimastr.com/redemption</a> for a download.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>RDF Representation of Outlook</h2>
<p>The nifty formats we use for Outlook can be found in the doc/ontology folder.
we used:
<ul>
  <li>Aperture Data Vocabulary</li>
  <li>ICAL as RDF</li>
  <li>VCARD as RDF</li>
</ul>
If we make extensions, the Aperture Vocabulary is the right place to expand. ICAL and VCARD are 
pretty fixed and should not be extended.
</p>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<p>The outlook nag screen will popup and we cannot remove that. Even using Outlook Redemption,
which removes this nag screen for many issues does not help when reading the e-mail adresses
of e-mail recipients. It just doesn't work.<p>
<p>Not all data of outlook is available. Repeating events are only limited extracted,
many other data items are missing. This is partly because we don't have the time
to code all that. You are welcome to improve that!</p>
<p>Threading and Memory leaks. We see that when crawling Outlook data, Java and Outlook memory
consumption rises significantly. Both may hang. Although we close all our handles, something
is wrong. Also, do not use the crawler in more than one thread. Seriously, multithreading 
over a Java-Com bridge is no fun.</p>
