A crawler implementation for Ical calendar files.
<p>
This implementation was base on the work of w3c rdf calendaring interest group.
Mainly on the contents of their RdfCalendarDocumentation wiki:

<p>
The Aperture Mapping differs from that in following respects:
<ol>
	<li>There are no anonymous nodes. All nodes that should be anonymous have
	    automatically generated unique URI's (with java.util.UUID class).
	<li>The calendar object itself and all calendar components have an additional
	    rdf:type data:DataObject triple.
</ol>
