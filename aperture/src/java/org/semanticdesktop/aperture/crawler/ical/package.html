A crawler implementation for Ical calendar files.
<p>
This implementation is a simple one. It assumes that all calendar objects are new.
They are reported to the CrawlerHandler as new ones. Future version may implement
some way to monitor the current state of calendar knowledge and report modified,
unmodified and removed objects.
<p>
There is no IcalAcessor. All knowledge-extraction logic is implemented within the
crawler itself. An accessor would be difficult to implement, because in order
to extract a single component from a calendar it would have to parse the whole
file, and to search it linearly. The second question would be to implement a
URI system for calendar components. We can't assume the existence of a UID
field in every component.
