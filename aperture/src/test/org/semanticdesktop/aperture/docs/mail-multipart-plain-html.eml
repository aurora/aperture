Dear SourceForge.net member, =


"By revolution we become more ourselves, not less."  -George Orwell

Open Source Software and the Open Source Software community are =
revolutionizing the way many companies source business applications. =


SourceForge.net is looking for open-source "experts and opinion-leaders" =
to help shed light on key issues surrounding the delivery of service and =
support for these applications.

Please enroll to share your unbiased and anonymous point of view.  We will =
reward you with a global platform on which to voice your thoughts.  And =
you will receive cash incentives from us as a "thank you" for doing so.

Over the next thirty days, we will be collecting input and advice from =
Project Administrators and open source users from around the globe---via =
online focus groups and interactive surveys.

We think that your thoughts are valuable---please help us ensure that they =
are heard. Click on the following link to get started. Additional project =
details are provided below.
http://survey.buzzsponge.com/wix/p0385210.aspx?r=3D3677&s=3DJXEOMCUN

PHASE 1: During the first phase, we will be conducting fun, interactive =
online discussion groups with software developers and project =
administrators who currently contribute to and/or use open source =
applications on SourceForge.net. Please note: spaces in Phase 1 are =
limited and will be filled based on the order in which people sign up by =
completing this online profile. =


* Each group will have 8 technology professionals who will participate in =
the collaborative dialogue.
* Each professional will be asked to participate in the online discussion =
group over a period of three days: =

        - Day 1: Wednesday, November 1 =

        - Day 2: Thursday, November 2
        - Day 3: Friday, November 3 =


* Each participant will be asked to log-on to the discussion board at =
least once a day on each of the three days listed above. =

* Participants should expect to spend approximately 15-20 minutes per day =
answering questions and adding to the dialogue in the online discussion =
forum. =

* Online discussions are easy and convenient! Participants can log-on and =
add to the discussion at any time of the day or night. =


*** As a thank you for your time, each participant in the Phase I =
discussion groups will receive US $75 for their participation. =
Additionally, the person who is judged to have the most complete responses =
at the end of the three day period will receive a US $100 bonus payment. =
****

PHASE 2: During the second phase, we will be conducting an online survey. =


* A link to the online survey will be emailed to all participating =
technology professionals during the week of November 20th. =

*  Participating technology professionals will be asked to complete the =
15-20 minute survey at some point during that week. =

* Participants can log-on and complete the questionnaire at any time of =
the day or night. =


****As a thank you for your time, each participant who completes the =
questionnaire will receive US $10****

In order to fully understand how we can better meet your needs, we need =
your help and we hope that you will be willing to participate in at least =
one of the phases listed above. As a reminder, the information you provide =
is completely confidential. SourceForge.net will not try to sell you =
anything during this survey or the focus group discussion. Your personal =
information will never be sold to a third party for any reason.
