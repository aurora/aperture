I have made some notes during the last weeks, I'll add them here soon.

I see. I'm still considering this, not sure whether it's a good approach:

pros:

- bindings for various RDF stores that we get for free

cons:

- is RDF2GO still using java.net.URIs? That would mean a lot of 
conversions that are potentially not necessary, e.g. when using a Sesame 
Repository: org.openrdf.model.URIs get translated to java.net.URIs and 
back to org.openrdf.model.URIs.

- RDFContainer lacks full RDF graph access. A simple getStatements 
method with a subject parameter would solve this though. I've also read 
comments by Gunnar about having to cast RDFContainer to 
SesameRDFContainer in code he wrote, I guess he had the same problem?

That's what I did with RepositoryAccessData. It wraps a Repository, 
which *can* be the same as used by the CrawlerHandler.

I'm already using this code in AutoFocus, which has dramatically 
improved the memory requirements of WebCrawler. This crawler used to 
keep the entire hypertext graph in main memory. Both the AccessData and 
the CrawlerHandler use the same Repository, using contexts to keep 
information separate (you really want to enforce that AccessData only 
reads and writes its own data).

However, the AccessData API limits the data that it can hold to simple 
key-value pairs, with the exception of the notion of "referred IDs", 
which are used for indicating links, nested objects, etc. Whenever you 
have some other graph-like data, you cannot store it properly in the 
AccessData, unless you're willing to encode multiple values in a single 
string. Also, the value is often a primitive value but can also be 
another URI (e.g. a redirectsTo property between two URLs). Right now 
these URIs are stored as literals by RepositoryAccessData.

Chris
