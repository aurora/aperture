Summary: URIs int AltRep

Initial Comment:
Using java.net.URI for internal representation causes 
problems with certain valid values like:

DESCRIPTION
 ;ALTREP="CID:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>"
 :Project description....

(This example has been taken from RFC 2445 4.2.1)

The java.net.URI constructor complains about the '<' 
sign in the URI. As a workaround, I switched the 
internal representation to string, and reimplemented 
the getUri method to:

public final URI getUri() throws URISyntaxException {
return new URI(Uris.encode(
        Strings.unquote(uriString)));
}

Summary: Arithmetic errors in GEO

Initial Comment:
I think that storing latitude and longitude as float 
values is a bad idea. I work with ical files, that 
have GEO property specified to six decimal digits. 
ical4j converts them to floats, converting them back 
to strings introduces substantial errors, that pose a 
real problem for me.

In my opinion the internal representation should be 
string, get/set value should also operate on these 
unchanged strings. getLatitutde and getLongitude can 
be provided for convenience, but they should compute 
the float representation on every call (or maybe 
introduce two parallel representations). All these 
changes are easy to introduce without changes in the 
interface.

If the ability to work with floats is really a 
priority - the solution with two parallel 
representations may be the best one... I attach a new 
version of the file - without the bugs. This one 
enables the user to work with get/set value without 
loss of information. get/set longitude/latitude are 
also provided and appropriate conversions are made.

Summary: Bug in setValue in Geo 

Initial Comment:
class net.fortuna.ical4j.model.property.Geo
method setValue (line 201)

This method looks as follows:

public final void setValue(final String aValue) {
 lattitude 
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(0,
     aValue.indexOf(';') - 1));
  longitude  
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(
     aValue.indexOf(';')));
}

This causes exceptions when parsing the second float:

... (some stack trace)
Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input 
string: ";-79.945815"
... (some stack trace)

I added a '+1' in the last line and the problem 
disappeared.

public final void setValue(final String aValue) {
 lattitude 
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(0,
     aValue.indexOf(';') - 1));
  longitude  
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(
     aValue.indexOf(';') + 1));
}

This guarantees that after

Geo geo = new Geo();
String value = "23.343432;65.344523"
geo.setValue(value);
String newValue = geo.getValue();
assertEquals(value,newValue);

always holds for every value.

Hi Antoni,

The reason I used floats to store the lattitude/longitude is
that the iCalendar spec. states for the GEO property:

    Value Type: FLOAT. The value MUST be two SEMICOLON
separated FLOAT values.

I've tried to be consistent in conforming to the types
specified in the spec. and the benefit it that it provides
additional validation of the iCalendar data.

However, obviously using ordinary floats is not sufficient
due to rounding issues, so I'd like to propose that instead
we use BigDecimals internally to the Geo implementation.
This should resolve the rounding issues, but retain type
validation.

I'll proceed with making this change now and confirm that it
resolves the problems you are seeing.

regards,
ben

Summary: Faulty URIs in AltRep

Initial Comment:
The usage of java.net.URI may not be the best idea. 
The RFC 2445 allows values like: 

ALTREP="CID:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>"

These also occur in example files like:
valid/calconnect9.ics

The parser fails on this file with the following error:

This is due to the java.net.URI constructor that 
complains about the '<' sign in the URI. This 
workaround uses string as an internal representation. 
The getURI() method creates an URI of that string. The 
interface is different. The URISyntaxException is 
thrown by getURI, not by the constructor. It may not 
be clean, but it works for me. Let the author decide 
on a permanent solution.

Hi Antoni,

I have investigated this problem and from what I can tell,
these URIs with '<' and '>' are actually not valid (even by
the RFC that defines how 'CID:' URIs are specified!). I
believe these invalid URIs are generated by Lotus Notes
(haven't heard of other CUAs doing this), so there is a
compatibility hint called 'NOTES_COMPATIBILITY', which can
be enabled as follows:

CompatibilityHints.setHintEnabled(CompatibilityHints.KEY_NOTES_COMPATIBILITY,
true);

When enabled, iCal4j will strip out the '<' and '>' from
URIs prior to constructing the URI instance.

regards,
ben

Summary: Bug in setValue in Geo 

Initial Comment:
class net.fortuna.ical4j.model.property.Geo
method setValue (line 201)

This method looks as follows:

public final void setValue(final String aValue) {
 lattitude 
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(0,
     aValue.indexOf(';') - 1));
  longitude  
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(
     aValue.indexOf(';')));
}

This causes exceptions when parsing the second float:

... (some stack trace)
Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input 
string: ";-79.945815"
... (some stack trace)

I added a '+1' in the last line and the problem 
disappeared.

public final void setValue(final String aValue) {
 lattitude 
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(0,
     aValue.indexOf(';') - 1));
  longitude  
   = Float.parseFloat(aValue.substring(
     aValue.indexOf(';') + 1));
}

Summary: Arithmetic errors in GEO

Initial Comment:
I think that storing latitude and longitude as float 
values is a bad idea. I work with ical files, that 
have GEO property specified to six decimal digits. 
ical4j converts them to floats, converting them back 
to strings introduces substantial errors, that pose a 
real problem for me.

In my opinion the internal representation should be 
string, get/set value should also operate on these 
unchanged strings. getLatitutde and getLongitude can 
be provided for convenience, but they should compute 
the float representation on every call (or maybe 
introduce two parallel representations). All these 
changes are easy to introduce without changes in the 
interface.

If the ability to work with floats is really a 
priority - the solution with two parallel 
representations may be the best one... I attach a new

enables the user to work with get/set value without

I've now introduced BigDecimals in place of floats for
internal representation of lattitude/longitude and the
precision errors appear to be resolved.

This fix is now available in CVS.

Summary: URIs int AltRep

Initial Comment:
Using java.net.URI for internal representation causes 
problems with certain valid values like:

DESCRIPTION
 ;ALTREP="CID:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>"
 :Project description....

(This example has been taken from RFC 2445 4.2.1)

The java.net.URI constructor complains about the '<' 
sign in the URI. As a workaround, I switched the 
internal representation to string, and reimplemented 
the getUri method to:

public final URI getUri() throws URISyntaxException {
return new URI(Uris.encode(
        Strings.unquote(uriString)));
}

Uris.encode() includes support for removing '<' and '>' from

Summary: Fix for Geo arithmetic

Initial Comment:
This guarantees that after

Geo geo = new Geo();
String value = "23.343432;65.344523"
geo.setValue(value);
String newValue = geo.getValue();
assertEquals(value,newValue);

always holds for every value.

Resolution of the defect was achieved using BigDecimals for
internal representation in place of floats.

Summary: Faulty URIs in AltRep

Initial Comment:
The usage of java.net.URI may not be the best idea. 
The RFC 2445 allows values like: 

ALTREP="CID:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>"

These also occur in example files like:
valid/calconnect9.ics

The parser fails on this file with the following error:

        ... 7 more

This is due to the java.net.URI constructor that 
complains about the '<' sign in the URI. This 
workaround uses string as an internal representation. 
The getURI() method creates an URI of that string. The 
interface is different. The URISyntaxException is 
thrown by getURI, not by the constructor. It may not 
be clean, but it works for me. Let the author decide 
on a permanent solution.

Dear SourceForge.net member, =


"By revolution we become more ourselves, not less."  -George Orwell

Open Source Software and the Open Source Software community are =
revolutionizing the way many companies source business applications. =


SourceForge.net is looking for open-source "experts and opinion-leaders" =
to help shed light on key issues surrounding the delivery of service and =
support for these applications.

Please enroll to share your unbiased and anonymous point of view.  We will =
reward you with a global platform on which to voice your thoughts.  And =
you will receive cash incentives from us as a "thank you" for doing so.

Over the next thirty days, we will be collecting input and advice from =
Project Administrators and open source users from around the globe---via =

We think that your thoughts are valuable---please help us ensure that they =
are heard. Click on the following link to get started. Additional project =
details are provided below.
http://survey.buzzsponge.com/wix/p0385210.aspx?r=3D3677&s=3DJXEOMCUN

PHASE 1: During the first phase, we will be conducting fun, interactive =
online discussion groups with software developers and project =
administrators who currently contribute to and/or use open source =
applications on SourceForge.net. Please note: spaces in Phase 1 are =
limited and will be filled based on the order in which people sign up by =
completing this online profile. =


* Each group will have 8 technology professionals who will participate in =
the collaborative dialogue.
* Each professional will be asked to participate in the online discussion =
group over a period of three days: =

        - Day 1: Wednesday, November 1 =

        - Day 2: Thursday, November 2
        - Day 3: Friday, November 3 =


* Each participant will be asked to log-on to the discussion board at =
least once a day on each of the three days listed above. =

* Participants should expect to spend approximately 15-20 minutes per day =
answering questions and adding to the dialogue in the online discussion =
forum. =

* Online discussions are easy and convenient! Participants can log-on and =
add to the discussion at any time of the day or night. =


*** As a thank you for your time, each participant in the Phase I =
discussion groups will receive US $75 for their participation. =
Additionally, the person who is judged to have the most complete responses =
at the end of the three day period will receive a US $100 bonus payment. =
****

PHASE 2: During the second phase, we will be conducting an online survey. =


* A link to the online survey will be emailed to all participating =
technology professionals during the week of November 20th. =

*  Participating technology professionals will be asked to complete the =
15-20 minute survey at some point during that week. =

* Participants can log-on and complete the questionnaire at any time of =
the day or night. =


****As a thank you for your time, each participant who completes the =
questionnaire will receive US $10****

In order to fully understand how we can better meet your needs, we need =
your help and we hope that you will be willing to participate in at least =
one of the phases listed above. As a reminder, the information you provide =
is completely confidential. SourceForge.net will not try to sell you =

3. Statistics


Dear SourceForge.net user:

Welcome to this month's edition of the SourceForge.net Site Update!
Thanks for reading.

As you may have noticed, we recently launched an update to our project
navigation that exposes more functionality in less space. We're hoping
these changes will make it easier for you to locate and use the tools
that are available for your favorite projects, and we're very interested
to hear what you think.

We are also finalizing the first of several improvements to our download
experience, which will simplify the process of choosing a download
mirror for the files our projects have published. Our engineers are now
working on ways to make it easier for users to locate the appropriate
files for their platform quickly.

Further out on our roadmap, we are working towards a partnership that
will allow us to offer comprehensive wiki functionality to our projects.
Not tomorrow, but soon!

Oh! And we're still hiring. If you know someone (or are someone) who
wants to work on SourceForge.net, check out our job postings at
http://www.vasoftware.com/company/careers.php - Extra points will be
given for those who live in the San Francisco Bay area or are willing
to relocate.

Thank you for your continued support of the Open Source software
movement and SourceForge.net.

Jay Seirmarco
General Manager

When the SF.net team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this: "Hey! I didn't ask to be on this list! You
spammer. I hate you! I hate your dog! (insert other colorful phrases
here)." The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net there was a
check box that said "Receive Site-wide updates, low volume." You left it
checked when you submitted the registration form, hence you are
receiving this email. We send these updates every 4 to 6 weeks, so it
truly is low volume. However if you want off, this is not a problem.

This SF.net update brought to you by HP
---------------------------------------------------------
Open source and Linux from HP
>From eight consecutive years of Linux market leadership to countless
community outreach programs, HP has proven solutions you can value, on a
next generation, highly-efficient BladeSystem platform ideal for Linux,
with the approach, experience, and customer commitment you can trust.
http://showcase.linux.com/hpos.tmpl
---------------------------------------------------------



Every now and then, we like to send our users a quick message to let
them know what we've been working on.  It's that time again, and we've
been busy as usual!

At the end of last year, we enabled automatic mirror detection for all
downloaded files.  Recently, we launched a feature designed to further
simplify our download process.  If you are a project administrator, you
can create download pages for each of your project's supported
platforms, and downloaders on Win32/OSX/Linux will be automatically
directed to the appropriate page.

We think this will make it easier for your users to locate the files
they're looking for.  So if your project has a lot of downloaders, you
should definitely check it out!  For more details, see
http://sourceforge.net/features/platformpages.php.

Stay tuned for more development on the wiki offering we mentioned a few
months back.  We've been working hard with our partner over the
holidays, and we plan to begin a limited beta this month.

Ross Turk, our Community Manager, will be speaking at the LinuxWorld
Open Solutions Summit in New York this Thursday.  Stop by and say hello!

Removed the 'middlegrained' manifests which weren't maintained and didn't
work anyway. Removed the term 'coarsegrained' from the ant script and the
names of the files. Fixed the names of the generated bundle gars. The
content of the manifests has been taken from the Nepomuk repository.

Greetings!  Welcome to the March edition of the SourceForge.net monthly
newsletter.  Thanks for reading.

This past month has been very busy for us!  Our team has continued to
grow, and we have become proportionally more ambitious.  A lot of what
we've been doing is behind-the-scenes, but there are a few things you
may have noticed.

First, we have completely rewritten our mailing list archiver and
reimported everything to ensure that HTML-based messages, attachments,
and URLs are now being properly displayed when browsing the contents of
our projects' mailing lists.  You may also notice that non-US character
sets are no longer acting funny.  Second, we have enabled statistics
support for CVS on anonymous reads, developer reads, and commits.  These
numbers will now be considered when calculating the activity ranking for
our CVS-based projects.

We're expecting to have an equally busy April, as more of our projects
come to light.  Stay tuned, there's much more to come.

Again, thanks for reading.

The SourceForge.net Team

When the SF.net team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this: "Hey! I didn't ask to be on this list! You
spammer. I hate you! I hate your dog! (insert other colorful phrases
here)." The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net there was a
check box that said "Receive Site-wide updates, low volume." You left it
checked when you submitted the registration form, hence you are
receiving this email. We send these updates every 4 to 6 weeks, so it
truly is low volume. However if you want off, this is not a problem.

Well, time is flying!  It seems like only yesterday when we sent our
last monthly email.

In the past few months, we've been hinting at a new set of features
we're developing that will allow you to buy and sell services for open
source projects.  We're getting close now, and we've started taking
names for our interest list.  If you're curious about what we've been up
to, sign up at https://ostg.wufoo.com/forms/marketplace-interest-list/
and we'll keep you in the loop.

We're preparing for the public launch of our integration with
Wikispaces, which will provide projects with dedicated, easy-to-use,
tightly-integrated wikis.  Keep your eyes peeled for a new Wiki link in
your project's Admin menu, which should pop up in the next few weeks.

Our Community Manager, Ross Turk, will be in Berlin at the end of May
for LinuxTag.  After the conference, he will be touring Europe to meet
with as many of you as possible.  If you've got a good story to tell us
about SourceForge.net, drop a line to ross@sourceforge.net - we may
be in your neighborhood!

Lastly, you may have noticed our recent announcement regarding
SourceForge Enterprise Edition.  If you haven't, check it out at:

Have a good month, and thanks for reading!

April Project of the Month: Art of Illusion
-------------------------------------------

Art of Illusion (AOI) is a 3-D graphics studio that provides modeling,
texturing, animation, and rendering in a single program. It is designed
to be easy to use so that new users can pick it up quickly, while still
providing advanced features to let experienced users create
professional-quality artwork. Its most striking feature is its simple
GUI, which provides access to powerful and sophisticated features. The
fact that it is written in pure Java gives it strong cross-platform
support, and with today's Java technology, performance is not an issue.
Finally, AOI is built on a strong core/plugin architecture, which makes
it easy for even programming neophytes to enhance AOI to suit their
purposes.

When the SF.net team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this: "Hey! I didn't ask to be on this list! You
spammer. I hate you! I hate your dog! (insert other colorful phrases
here)." The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net there was a
check box that said "Receive Site-wide updates, low volume." You left it
checked when you submitted the registration form, hence you are
receiving this email. We send these updates every 4 to 6 weeks, so it
truly is low volume. However if you want off, this is not a problem.

Hi, and welcome to the June edition of our monthly newsletter!

You've probably noticed the beta launch of our new SourceForge.net
Marketplace, a platform for buying and selling services for open source
software.  If you haven't, we encourage you to check it out and let us
know what you think!  Anybody can buy during the beta period, but the
number of sellers is limited for now.  If you'd like to become a seller
in our beta program, be sure to add your name to the interest list at
http://sourceforge.net/survey/ .

We're also proud to announce the general availability of our new project
wikis!  These easy to use and fully-functional wikis, powered by
Wikispaces, allow collaboration on project documentation and other
dynamic content.  You can enable them in your project by choosing the
Wiki link in your project's Admin tab.  We'd also like to extend our

better for the rest of us!

We've begun our 2007 Community Choice Awards nomination process.  You
can nominate projects to win by clicking on the link on their project
summary and download pages.

Lastly, VA Software, the company that owns and operates SourceForge.net,

Legacy Subversion Access Method Going Away
------------------------------------------

Back in November of 2006, we added a new preferred access method for our
Subversion offering that solved most of the spurious error messages and
other problems with our initial SVN rollout.  The change introduced a
new URL scheme:

https://PROJECTNAME.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/PROJECTNAME

Users have been receiving the notice to upgrade via a Site Status
announcement and as needed via Support Request when problems were reported.

As a part of our ongoing infrastructure improvements to our Subversion
offering and other services, we will be decommissioning the legacy
access method (the one without the PROJECTNAME prefix for the hostname)
as of June 28.  Past that time, Subversion operations that use the old
URL scheme will no longer work.  You may change over any existing
Subversion checkouts you have by following the instructions detailed here:

https://sourceforge.net/docs/E09#notice

Subversion offering that solved most of the spurious error messages and
other problems with our initial SVN rollout.  The change introduced a
new URL scheme:

https://PROJECTNAME.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/PROJECTNAME

Users have been receiving the notice to upgrade via a Site Status
announcement and as needed via Support Request when problems were reported.

As a part of our ongoing infrastructure improvements to our Subversion
offering and other services, we will be decommissioning the legacy
access method (the one without the PROJECTNAME prefix for the hostname)
as of June 28.  Past that time, Subversion operations that use the old
URL scheme will no longer work.  You may change over any existing
Subversion checkouts you have by following the instructions detailed here:

https://sourceforge.net/docs/E09#notice

When the SF.net team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this: "Hey! I didn't ask to be on this list! You
spammer. I hate you! I hate your dog! (insert other colorful phrases
here)." The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net there was a
check box that said "Receive Site-wide updates, low volume." You left it
checked when you submitted the registration form, hence you are
receiving this email. We send these updates every 4 to 6 weeks, so it
truly is low volume. However if you want off, this is not a problem.

Summary: Remove validation from the XmlExtractor

Initial Comment:
Problems have been reported when the XmlExtractor tries to download DTD's or XSD's that aren't available at the moment. This breaks the crawling process. In our particular use case, where the extractor is supposed to extract text no validation is necessary or?

Summary: Swing examples don't work

Initial Comment:
The Swing examples don't work.

The imapcrawler.CrawlerFrame. The wizard is OK, but when the crawle is started the window is not notified of the changes in the status. This is because the "observable properties" in the ExampleImapCrawler class aren't in fact observable after the SimpleCrawlerHandler got externalized to a separate class.

The filecrawler.CrawlerFrame works ok, the crawling status is shown on the JPanel. When the crawler stops crawling, an appropriate information is shown on the panel but no output is written to a file.

Summary: Make the IcalCrawler more compliant with RFC 2445

Initial Comment:
Following issues have been identified with the IcalCrawler.

1. Four parameters that have nco:Contact as their range are treated wrong by the crawler:
- delegatedFrom
- delegatedTo
- member
- sentBy

2. the range of dir parameter is a resource, not a literal

3. quite a lot of properties do theoretically accept multiple comma-separated values, this should be solved in a generic way, 

4. the language parameter should result in a language tag to the literal, this is not supported yet

5. the attachments are untested

The issues mentioned above arose because they were not covered by the test suite, this should be fixed

Summary: Unify handling of emails

Initial Comment:
Investigate ways to unify code between MIME extractor and the IMAP crawler. Both of them work with java.mail api. There should be a single class that converts between a javax.mail.Message or javax.mail.MimeMessage and rdf. It could potentially be reused in other future components build on java.mail (e.g. in local mailbox crawlers). All of this should use all make extensive use of NMO and NCO.

Summary: Reintroduce the distinction between from and sender

Initial Comment:
"From:" and "Sender:" are two different headers in a MIME message. They mean different things. Currently both of them are mapped to NMO.from. Add a sender property to NMO and fix this in the IMAP crawler and the MIME extractor.

Summary: Attachments have no file name

Initial Comment:
Attachments reported by the ImapCrawler no longer have a file name since the NIE branch was merged.

This can probably be fixed by outcommenting line 637 in DataObjectFactory:

//copyString(DATA.name, map, metadata);

and replacing DATA.name with NFO.fileName, but I didn't check this yet.

Summary: ImapCrawler fails to report multi-valued headers

Initial Comment:
It appears that when IMAP mails have multiple contacts in the to or cc header (probably also occurs with the other headers but haven't checked this), only one of them is reported in the metadata of the mail's DataObject.

This behavior only occurs with the NIE-based source, the development code of June 29th 2007 perfectly reported multi-value headers.

Summary: Reintroduce the distinction between from and sender

Initial Comment:
"From:" and "Sender:" are two different headers in a MIME message. They mean different things. Currently both of them are mapped to NMO.from. Add a sender property to NMO and fix this in the IMAP crawler and the MIME extractor.

Fixed, added a property to NMO and changed the code. This property has not
been included in the actual NMO, i will try to sneak it there. If the
TF-Ont authorities proove unflexible, the property will have to be moved to
some kind of an aperture-specific vocabulary class.

This is a good opportunity to evaluate what other headers could be
introduced in NMO. A good resource is the RFC 2076,
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2076.txt.

Summary: give ImapDataSource (and possibly other DSes) multiple roots

Initial Comment:
ImapCrawler allows a ImapDataSource to have multiple basepath properties but the ImapDataSource API assumes a single basepath property. Can we add support for setting a collection (list?) of basepaths on an ImapDataSource?

Also, why shouldn't we allow other sources to have multiple root folders/start URLs/whatever as well?

The only drawback of this approach is that other properties such as maximum depth etc. are global for the entire data source, i.e., you cannot specify different maximum depths for different folders, you need a separate data source for that.

Summary: Bring the rootFolderOf property back

Initial Comment:
The non-nie branch contained the rootFolderOf property, it marked the root element of the crawled RDF. There are many uses for it. E.g. if you want to render a tree of all extracted elements it is non-trivial to get to know with what you should begin. That's why the rootFolder nice. The name could be changed though to some kind of rootElement or rootDataContainer or whatever...

A new property has been introduced into NIE - rootElementOf. It resides on
my hard disk at the moment and has not been officially acknowledged by the
NIE maintainers yet. I hope that it will get into the official ontology,
otherwise we will have to create and maintain our own namespace with
Aperture NIE extensions.

Summary: Let all crawlers use rootElementOf

Initial Comment:
It may to impose a constraint that ALL crawlers must create a tree of DataObjects rooted at an object linked with rootElementOf with the data source. A test could be written that would ensure that ALL data objects are within the tree, that each object occurs only once, it is a normal tree, not a DAG i.e. there is only one path from a root to any given object. A data source can have many roots.

Summary: JpgExtractor prints to stdout

Initial Comment:
The JpgExtractor (or actually: the extraction library used in it) prints messages to System.out. We should try to prevent this from happening (hack the code, submit a patch to the author) as in production systems this is a real nuisance.

I am not sure what the message it prints really means:

"Problem reading picture: Invalid image type 0, on picture with length 0.
You document will probably become corrupted if you save it!"

Perhaps an exception is justified?

I downloaded the source code and browsed through it. It's weird. The
System.out occurs only in the main method and in some test classes, there
is no single occurence of "corrupted" or "Invalid image type". I doubt
those errors have been caused by the underlying library. Theoretically it's
possible that the jar does not correspond to the source code, that's why I
compiled the library myself. Please test if this solves your problem, if it
doesn't please try to isolate the file that causes those message to appear
and send it to me, so that I can try to dig into it further.

My bad, it turns out that it is actually POI that is complaining about the
internals of a PowerPoint file. As this problem surfaced right after I
included the JpgExtractor in my app, I immediately and incorrectly assumed
that it was related to this new extractor. Apologies for the confusion.

Summary: Remove validation from the XmlExtractor

Initial Comment:
Problems have been reported when the XmlExtractor tries to download DTD's or XSD's that aren't available at the moment. This breaks the crawling process. In our particular use case, where the extractor is supposed to extract text no validation is necessary or?

After two days of investigations it turns out that this is the same as
#1481111? I had problems with creating a unit test for this, but these can
only be attributed to my ignorance in the basics of XML. I've added four
new unit tests with xml files that reference non-existent DTD's and XSD's.
All of them pass without problems. I've sent an email to Christian
Reuschling form DFKI - the original reporter of this problem. If he doesn't
provide a satisfying answer I'll close this ticket.

Summary: Swing examples don't work

Initial Comment:
The Swing examples don't work.

The imapcrawler.CrawlerFrame. The wizard is OK, but when the crawle is started the window is not notified of the changes in the status. This is because the "observable properties" in the ExampleImapCrawler class aren't in fact observable after the SimpleCrawlerHandler got externalized to a separate class.

The filecrawler.CrawlerFrame works ok, the crawling status is shown on the JPanel. When the crawler stops crawling, an appropriate information is shown on the panel but no output is written to a file.

Summary: webservice: changes

Initial Comment:
I also spotted a glitch: when processing http://www.w3.org/, the 
resulting XML cannot be shown by IE: it barks about the ö in Österreich. 
This could be a Sesame problem: I believe they chose to just assume 
UTF-8 encoding rather than processing each string, for performance 
reasons. I'll ask Arjohn when he gets back from holiday.

I would rename "web site" to "web page", the former may give the 
impression that we are going to crawl the entire site.


Leo:
change the output mime-type to rdf/xml

accept both GET and POST for ?url=x

I fixed the examples. The output generated by the examples is printed to
an output stream, not to a writer. Now the unicode characters are printed
correctly. My advise is: use an output stream, not a writer. Sesame doesn't
seem to have problems with storing unicode strings. I will close this
ticket, if any specific problems occur - please send them here.

OK. It turned out that it wasn't Christiaan Reuschling but Heinz Kirchman
who reported this error. It was caused by a faulty XML file with a missing
DTD. The problem was not that the DTD was missing, but an attribute that
was defined twice in the same element. It's illegal in XML. It caused a SAX
Exception but the logger logged only the previous FileNotFoundException.
Christiaan wrote in the comments that it's probably more useful to log the
previous FileNotFoundException, it's not. It's misguiding. I fixed this
error message and close this issue.

Summary: ImapCrawler needs lazy connection handling

Initial Comment:
ImapCrawler currently has a public closeConnection
method that needs to be invoked when people use the
DataAccessor methods (getDataObject and
getDataObjectIfModified).

Once this method is invoked, access to the
FileDataObject's InputStreams can result in
IOExceptions in IMAPInputStream (a Javamail class).

Also, FileDataObjects kept around until after the crawl
method has finished also have the same problem because
the crawl method also explicitly closes the connection.

A better way to handle this is to have some sort of
connection handling mechanism that is used by both
ImapCrawler and the FileDataObject implementation it
uses so that a connection can be established whenever
it's needed.

Summary: Let all crawlers use rootElementOf

Initial Comment:
It may to impose a constraint that ALL crawlers must create a tree of DataObjects rooted at an object linked with rootElementOf with the data source. A test could be written that would ensure that ALL data objects are within the tree, that each object occurs only once, it is a normal tree, not a DAG i.e. there is only one path from a root to any given object. A data source can have many roots.

RootElementOf relation before doing anything else -- hence this is most
important (9) now.

Summary: OpenDocumentExtractor should extract all available metadata

Initial Comment:
The current OpenDocumentExtractor only passes along
those metadata fields that correspond to a predicate in
Aperture's namespace. However, these attributes are
stored in the document as simple strings with a
"namespaced key". Therefore, OpenDocumentExtractor
should convert these to RDF statements with the element
names as predicates and also map them to Aperture
predicates where applicable. This strategy is also
successfully used in OpenXmlExtractor.

Fixed, copied some code from the OpenXmlExtractor. Only the
meta:user-defined fields aren't supported. I'd like to clarify it with the
Nepomuk Consortium first. Having undefined properties is one thing, but
having untyped blank nodes is something completely different. I'd have to
introduce a class called "UserDefinedProperty" with a name and value, this
would make everything VERY confusing.

Initial Comment:
We need to implement the semdesk hack that we had in mind in august.

The URI scheme is described here:

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/SemdeskUris

I changed the scheme to use domain names as application identifiers - comments?

changes need to be done to Outlook first, other things can wait. 

At the end, this won't take long, we just have to hardcode one string somewhere. "semdesk:"

Summary: Let all crawlers use rootElementOf

Initial Comment:
It may to impose a constraint that ALL crawlers must create a tree of DataObjects rooted at an object linked with rootElementOf with the data source. A test could be written that would ensure that ALL data objects are within the tree, that each object occurs only once, it is a normal tree, not a DAG i.e. there is only one path from a root to any given object. A data source can have many roots.

Summary: Release Aperture 1.0 beta 1

Initial Comment:
The code seems to be very stable now and the APIs haven't changed a bit recently. There are ideas for API improvements (extended CrawlerHandler, SubCrawler, Extractor) but those are not likely to happen any time soon, so I propose to move to a 1.0 release now and save those improvements for a 2.0 release.

First target: get a 1.0 beta 1 release out of the door before ISWC.

Summary: IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant

Initial Comment:
The IMAP URI's produced by aperture are not RFC 2192
compliant.

Quote from the RFC [1]:

     [..]
     An IMAP URL referring to a specific message or
message part has the
     following form:

        
imap://<iserver>/<enc_mailbox>[uidvalidity]<iuid>[isection]

     [..]

     iuid             = "/;UID=" nz_number
                             ; See [IMAP4] for
"nz_number" definition

An example of an URI currenlty produced by the example
imap crawler of aperture is:

imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/225

whereas it should be:
 
imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/;UID=225

I agree with prority 7.

There is a possible implementation (which is doing something like the
right thing) here:
http://gnowsis.opendfki.de/browser/tags/0.8.3-alpha/gnowsis_email/WEB-INF/src/org/gnowsis/email/config/StoreConfig.java#L253

Take this code as a start.

This is inherently broken, though because IMAP Folder URIs are based on a
weird Problem:
The IMAP Uris seem to be UTF7-IMAP encoded, a weird encoding scheme which
exists only for that purpose. Only I cannot get the corresponding decoder
to run, it is the XPCOM class
@mozilla.org/intl/unicode/decoder;1?charset=x-imap4-modified-utf7 In Java,
the specified encoding seems not to be available. In PHP it is, called
imap_utf7_encode(). also, it is not deterministic how this thing works, the
same string can have two different UTF7-IMAP representations. 
Test: Böser 
enc1: B&lA-ser 
enc2: B&APY-ser

Summary: FileInspector does not show full-text in designated tab

Initial Comment:
The FileInspector does not show the full-text in the designated tab, though the full-text triples occur in the extracted metadata. 

The problem seems to be in the MetadataModel class: it does not take all full-text properties into account. Perhaps it implicitly assumes an inferencing Model implementation, as it only queries for NIE.plainTextContent?

Summary: Code distributed with release does not compile

Initial Comment:
The code that is bundled with the 1.0 alpha 4 release as a src.zip file does not compile. The reason for this is that the org.semanticdesktop.aperture.opener is not included in the src.zip, though there is code in the src/java (OutlookCrawler) and src/examples trees (various files) that depend on it.

Summary: OpenDocumentExtractor should extract all available metadata

Initial Comment:
The current OpenDocumentExtractor only passes along
those metadata fields that correspond to a predicate in
Aperture's namespace. However, these attributes are
stored in the document as simple strings with a
"namespaced key". Therefore, OpenDocumentExtractor
should convert these to RDF statements with the element
names as predicates and also map them to Aperture
predicates where applicable. This strategy is also
successfully used in OpenXmlExtractor.

Fixed, copied some code from the OpenXmlExtractor. Only the
meta:user-defined fields aren't supported. I'd like to clarify it with the
Nepomuk Consortium first. Having undefined properties is one thing, but
having untyped blank nodes is something completely different. I'd have to
introduce a class called "UserDefinedProperty" with a name and value, this
would make everything VERY confusing.

Summary: PoiUtil bug - working with streams that don't support mark()

Initial Comment:
I've been trying to solve the issue
[ 1815159 ] Code distributed with release does not compile

It looked like a trivial change build.xml (which I did). The problem was that the tests didn't pass. It is very weird. The tests ran fine from eclipse, ran fine with the 'ant test', 'ant release' went OK, but when I tried to unzip the src.zip in the release folder and run 'ant test' from there it failed.

For some inexplicable reason the getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() returns BufferedInputStreams in Eclipse but FileInputStreams in ant (with the fork="no" atribute of the junit task, originally it was fork="yes" but I experimented). 

This problem raised its head with the PublisherExtractor. It is one of the few extractors that require TWO passes over the stream. The first one to extract the metadata, the second one to extract the full-text. Therefore it DEPENDS on the ability of the underlying stream to support mark. 

I would like to make PoiUtil.extractMetadata and PoiUtil.extractAll methods return an input stream. They seem to cover the case if the stream doesn't support mark and wrap it in a BufferedInputStream. The BufferedInputStream but it is not returned so the underlying stream stays empty.

Fixed. PublisherExtractor, PresentationsExtractor and QuattroExtractor CAN
work with streams that don't support mark() by wrapping them in
BufferedInputStreams.

After some investigation I discovered that the same problem applies to
PresentationsExtractor and QuattroExtractor. They work only with streams
that support mark().

Summary: Code distributed with release does not compile

Initial Comment:
The code that is bundled with the 1.0 alpha 4 release as a src.zip file does not compile. The reason for this is that the org.semanticdesktop.aperture.opener is not included in the src.zip, though there is code in the src/java (OutlookCrawler) and src/examples trees (various files) that depend on it.

After a couple of days of banging my head against the wall (discovering
and fixing issue 1818479 in the process) the code in src.zip does compile
and the 'ant test' task runs successfully. I didn't test ant release. I
consider this enought to close this ticket.

Summary: Let all crawlers use rootElementOf

Initial Comment:
It may to impose a constraint that ALL crawlers must create a tree of DataObjects rooted at an object linked with rootElementOf with the data source. A test could be written that would ensure that ALL data objects are within the tree, that each object occurs only once, it is a normal tree, not a DAG i.e. there is only one path from a root to any given object. A data source can have many roots.

All instances of the DataObject class and it's subclasses are organized
into a set of directed graphs. Each graph MAY contain cycles and MUST
contain a single node marked with the rootElementOf property. There are no
guarantees as to the position of that node in the graph

Leo: made this high priority, as any visualization we will do will use the
RootElementOf relation before doing anything else -- hence this is most
important (9) now.

Summary: Implement IMAP URI Validation

Initial Comment:
While working on the issue entitled '[ 1565163 ] IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant' I did some research about how to solve it 'right'. 

I started to read about the UTF7 issue. It has not been included in the JDK. People have been asking Sun for SEVEN YEARS to implement it but they didn't. (See the bug database http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4304013).

There is an interesting project though called JUTF7 (http://jutf7.sourceforge.net). I downloaded it, it works. I even included a -testuris switch in the IMAP application, so that I could validate those URIs. It prooved difficult. In order to do it really correctly one would have to do the following:

1. Figure out which parts of the URI can contain non-ASCII characters that need to be escaped wihth UTF7. 
2. Use JUTF7 in the IMAPCrawler so that it prepares those URIS properly. I.e. MailUtil.convertStringToUTF7, note that this is tricky since a login can contain '@' (like antoni_mylka@fastmail.net which is the login to my test IMAP account) which need to be URL-Encoded whereas the folder names can contain ąęółłśśććżźć (Polish) or äöü etc. which need to be UTF7-encoded

3. Write a real public static boolean isImapUriValid in the MailUtil class, it would:

a. have a JavaCC grammar that would check the correctness of the URI (RFC 2192 contains a beautiful ABNF syntax specification).

b. check the appropriate parts for the presence of non-ASCII characters, if they are encoded correctly (URL-encoding in the login, UTF7 in the folder name)

All of this is quite a lot. I therefore open a new ticket and ask for comments.

Summary: IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant

Initial Comment:
The IMAP URI's produced by aperture are not RFC 2192
compliant.

Quote from the RFC [1]:

     [..]
     An IMAP URL referring to a specific message or
message part has the
     following form:

        
imap://<iserver>/<enc_mailbox>[uidvalidity]<iuid>[isection]

     [..]

     iuid             = "/;UID=" nz_number
                             ; See [IMAP4] for
"nz_number" definition

An example of an URI currenlty produced by the example
imap crawler of aperture is:

imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/225

whereas it should be:
 
imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/;UID=225

[1] http://rfc.net/rfc2192.html

I've fixed that particular problem described by the original submitter.
The URIs of messages aren't

imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/225

but

imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/;UID=225

This doesn't solve the whole issue though. I've fixed that particular
problem described by the original submitter. The URIs of messages aren't

imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/225

but

imap://imap.myserver.com/subfolder/;UID=225

This doesn't solve the whole issue though. See the feature request 1823660
for continuation. Given the limited time for the next release I'd like to
leave it as it is and close this ticket for the time being.

I agree with prority 7.

There is a possible implementation (which is doing something like the
right thing) here:
http://gnowsis.opendfki.de/browser/tags/0.8.3-alpha/gnowsis_email/WEB-INF/src/org/gnowsis/email/config/StoreConfig.java#L253

Take this code as a start.

This is inherently broken, though because IMAP Folder URIs are based on a
weird Problem:
The IMAP Uris seem to be UTF7-IMAP encoded, a weird encoding scheme which
exists only for that purpose. Only I cannot get the corresponding decoder
to run, it is the XPCOM class
@mozilla.org/intl/unicode/decoder;1?charset=x-imap4-modified-utf7 In Java,
the specified encoding seems not to be available. In PHP it is, called
imap_utf7_encode(). also, it is not deterministic how this thing works, the
same string can have two different UTF7-IMAP representations. 
Test: Böser 
enc1: B&lA-ser 
enc2: B&APY-ser

Summary: move  to semdesk uri scheme

Initial Comment:
We need to implement the semdesk hack that we had in mind in august.

The URI scheme is described here:

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/SemdeskUris

I changed the scheme to use domain names as application identifiers - comments?

changes need to be done to Outlook first, other things can wait. 

At the end, this won't take long, we just have to hardcode one string somewhere. "semdesk:"

No it's not. This will invalidate the OutlookAccessorFactory and
OutlookOpenerFactory, because there will be no 'outlook' URI scheme
anymore. This will have direct consequenses for Nepomuk Users, who need the
(access|refresh|open)Resource methods to work for Outlook resources. 

See the Nepomuk ticket no 78
http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/ticket/78
OlafGrebner kept bugging me about it.

The semdesk hack will necessitate a rewrite of aperture registries, so
that they won't work with uri SCHEMES (i.e. the part before the colon) but
with arbitrary uri PREFIXES (which may reach only to the first colon, but
may also go further (semdesk://localhost/outlook)). I would like to hear
some more comments before doing this.

Summary: Convert website crawler to use NAO

Initial Comment:
The Flickr, Del.icio.us, Bibsonomy and IPhoto crawlers use a temporary quick-and-dirty hack from Gnowsis i.e. the TAGGING ontology. NAO is much better for this purpose (apart from being an 'official' ontology of the Nepomuk Project). The websites crawlers should be converted to use NAO and the TAGGING ontology should be removed altogether.

we need it for desktop:
* desktop://outlook
* desktop://email
* desktop://thunderbird

the main goal is to minimize the non-standard behavior we have, making up
multiple imaginary desktop protocols is unhealthy. one imaginary protocol
"desktop" has the chance to be registered sometimes.

we also need it for web 2.0 applications:
* http://www.flickr.com/photos/*

We could write a special DataAccessor that reacts to these kind of online
uris, invoking a proper data extraction using the web apis or page scraping
instead of just extracting the plaintext from the HTML.

Still, there is a problem of passing in the datasource, once a
DataAccessor is retrieved using the DataAccessorRegistry.get(String scheme)
method, I cannot pass the right datasource to
DataAccessor.getDataObject(String url, DataSource source, Map params,
RDFContainerFactory containerFactory) throws UrlNotFoundException,
IOException;

The Outlook, Thunderbird, Flickr, etc DataAccessors would need the correct
DataSource to know the password or other configuration options that are not
encoded in the URI. 
For this, I would again urge to add a "canContainURI(String uri)" method
to the DataSource interface, that returns true (or these 0-200 values)
indicating if it can contain a URI. we had this discussion before - where
is it documented?

problem is that some "schemes" can be part of a "prefix" also, I would add
both functionalities to the dataaccessors to be on the save side, and
perhaps also add the possibility of regular expressions for uri parsing (to
say "yes" both to http and https versions, etc).

Summary: Implement IMAP URI Validation

Initial Comment:
While working on the issue entitled '[ 1565163 ] IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant' I did some research about how to solve it 'right'. 

I started to read about the UTF7 issue. It has not been included in the JDK. People have been asking Sun for SEVEN YEARS to implement it but they didn't. (See the bug database http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4304013).

There is an interesting project though called JUTF7 (http://jutf7.sourceforge.net). I downloaded it, it works. I even included a -testuris switch in the IMAP application, so that I could validate those URIs. It prooved difficult. In order to do it really correctly one would have to do the following:

1. Figure out which parts of the URI can contain non-ASCII characters that need to be escaped wihth UTF7. 
2. Use JUTF7 in the IMAPCrawler so that it prepares those URIS properly. I.e. MailUtil.convertStringToUTF7, note that this is tricky since a login can contain '@' (like antoni_mylka@fastmail.net which is the login to my test IMAP account) which need to be URL-Encoded whereas the folder names can contain ąęółłśśććżźć (Polish) or äöü etc. which need to be UTF7-encoded

3. Write a real public static boolean isImapUriValid in the MailUtil class, it would:

a. have a JavaCC grammar that would check the correctness of the URI (RFC 2192 contains a beautiful ABNF syntax specification).

b. check the appropriate parts for the presence of non-ASCII characters, if they are encoded correctly (URL-encoding in the login, UTF7 in the folder name)

All of this is quite a lot. I therefore open a new ticket and ask for comments.

JUTF7 is good input, I didn'T find that library.

I would do it like this:
We have the problem two times:
* on creating the uris for crawled e-mails. Then its easy, you only encode
the names of the folders in the PATH using UTF7,
scheme://username:pwd@host/path --> only the <path> is to be UTF7

* when implementing dataAccessor. Then, you need to get the username from
the datasource (see the other ticket on desktop:Uri: we NEED a
canContainUri() method on the datasources). In dataAccessor, you use a
java.net.URI to parse the uri, and it should contain user, host, password,
protocol properly, the path can be transformed with UTF7.

The URI scheme is described here:

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/SemdeskUris

I changed the scheme to use domain names as application identifiers - comments?

changes need to be done to Outlook first, other things can wait. 

At the end, this won't take long, we just have to hardcode one string somewhere. "semdesk:"

No it's not. This will invalidate the OutlookAccessorFactory and
OutlookOpenerFactory, because there will be no 'outlook' URI scheme
anymore. This will have direct consequenses for Nepomuk Users, who need the
(access|refresh|open)Resource methods to work for Outlook resources. 

See the Nepomuk ticket no 78
http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/ticket/78
OlafGrebner kept bugging me about it.

The semdesk hack will necessitate a rewrite of aperture registries, so
that they won't work with uri SCHEMES (i.e. the part before the colon) but
with arbitrary uri PREFIXES (which may reach only to the first colon, but
may also go further (semdesk://localhost/outlook)). I would like to hear
some more comments before doing this.

We've had a little chat with Leo on Skype today. The constraints we are
trying to satisfy are:

1. Keep the current schemes intact, file://, http://, https:// should work
as expected, the same would apply to ftp://, webdav://, gopher etc.
2. The schemes that aren't stadardized (outlook:// etc.) should be
substituted with the semdesk:// scheme with appropriate prefixes. The
accessor, and opener registries should be adjusted.
3. It should be possible to distinguish between a generic accessor (http)
and a specific accessor (flickr).

We agreed that the basic prefix-processing is too little. It wouldn't
cover the http vs. https case etc. DataSource implementations must be
allowed to do more advanced URI parsing. That's why it's better to have a
canContainUri method.

Solution 1
1. public int DataSource.canContainUri - the implementation may or may not
take the information in the data source configuration into account. The
number returned is the number of the characters in the URI that make up the
necessary condition. For FileSystemDataSource we have
startsWith(rootFolder), for Web we have startsWith rootUrl, or fallsWithin
domain boundaries. It is impossible to set up a mathematically sound
contract for this method and the value should be used as a HINT as to
whether the data source CAN contain a resource. No guarantees are given. If
the URI violates some restriction (e.g. it is outside of the domain
boundaries), a negative value is returned.
2. public DataAccessorFactory DataSource.getDataAccessorFactory
3. public DataOpenerFactory DataSource.getDataOpenerFactory

Solution 2
1. public int DataSource.canContainUri - as above
2. public int DataAccessorFactory.canContainUri - unclear, only most basic
regex processing is permissible since the dataAccessorFactory doesn't have
access to the data source configuration
3. public int DataOpenerFactory.canContainUri - unclear, only most basic
regex processing is permissible since the dataAccessorFactory doesn't have
access to the data source configuration
Advantage: theoretically even without a data source a
semdesk://localhost/outlook uri may b e recognized by an
OutlookAccessorFactory
Disadvantage: theoretically cases may occur when an URI is recognized by a
DataSource, but is not recognized by any DataAccessorFactory, due to some
source-specific parts of the URI.  Can they? 

I would personally go for the second solution since I can't come up with
any meaningful examples when problems might occur. Does anyone have a
better idea?

Summary: Let all crawlers use rootElementOf

Initial Comment:
It may to impose a constraint that ALL crawlers must create a tree of DataObjects rooted at an object linked with rootElementOf with the data source. A test could be written that would ensure that ALL data objects are within the tree, that each object occurs only once, it is a normal tree, not a DAG i.e. there is only one path from a root to any given object. A data source can have many roots.

I tried to make the IMAP crawler output a valid tree (with respect to
hasPart/isPartOf relations). After much toil and trouble (and fixing the
nrl validator in the process see
http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/changeset/3632). I've stumbled upon
an issue with the attachments. The crawler adds two isPartOf links to each
attachment, one link to the enclosing email, the second link to the
enclosing folder. This breaks the tree. 

The second link is added in ImapCrawler.java line 707 - the registerParent
method. I don't fully understand it's meaning and therefore won't try to
'fix' it. I'd be grateful for comments from Christiaan, who wrote the
IMAPCrawler.

Based on any protocol. A single crawler would be able to monitor local
.ics files as well as remote calendars, published as .ics files. This would
greatly enhance the usability of the ICAL crawler. There are quite a lot of
.ics calendars available on the web.

After a discussion with Leo, it turned out that my understanding of this
issue was too broad. Therefore I settled for a simple solution with the
RootElementModelTester added to all command line examples. It guarantees
that there ARE root elements without making any further assumptions about
them. The issue to implement more rigorous constraints is continued in the
ticket '[ 1825550 ] Implement a set of guarantees about the crawler
output'

All crawlers insert the root element triples. In case of the tag crawlers
and the AppleAddressbookCrawler a simple solution has been adopted that
makes all extracted data objects (i.e. all tags and all contacts from an
apple addressbook) root elements of the data source. This allows the
validation to pass.

Therefore I close this ticket for the time being. If you have any further
comments, place them under '[ 1825550 ] Implement a set of guarantees about
the crawler output'.

Summary: Implement a set of guarantees about the crawler output

Initial Comment:
While working on the issue number '[ 1800656 ] Let all crawlers use rootElementOf' It turned out that my understanding of that task was too broad, therefore I create a new ticket.

On the first glance I wanted to implement a test that would guarantee that the DataObjects extracted by the crawlers form a valid containment tree. This was inline with my ideas expressed in the NIE specification:

http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie/

I developed a ModelTester for this purpose. It has been uploaded ot the Nepomuk SVN Repository and became a part of the nrlvalidator.jar. See here

http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/repos/trunk/sandbox/org.semanticdesktop.nepomuk.nrl.validator/src/main/java/org/semanticdesktop/nepomuk/nrl/validator/testers/DataObjectTreeModelTester.java

It turned out that the simple assumption that everything is a tree became difficult to implement. After complaints from Christiaan I adjusted the constraint from

"All DataObjects are part of a tree with the root element at the top"

to 

"All DataObjects are part of a tree with the root element at the top, but the root element may be connected to a one higher-level element"

... to allow for the fact that a root element may contain references for the non-crawled resources. With this assumption. I succeded with implementing this check for the FileSystemCrawler, IcalCrawler and ThunderbirdCrawler. 

For all other crawler, I resorted to a trivial check if there are any root elements, without any assumptions if  the root elements are in any sane relation to other data objects. This is done with the RootElementModelTester. Clearly, a guarantee that there are some root elements is not enough to do anything useful with them.

So the task is
1. What constraints can be imposed on the output of other crawlers. They should be more rigorous than the one implemented in the RootElementModelTester

2. How to express these constraints with a model tester.

3. Add that model tester to the unit tests of those crawlers, and to the getAdditionalModelTester method in the appropriate Example...Crawler class in the examples folder.

4. Tweak the actual crawler as long as it takes for the unit tests to pass and for the command line example to stop reporting validation errors.

Summary: Implement IMAP URI Validation

Initial Comment:
While working on the issue entitled '[ 1565163 ] IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant' I did some research about how to solve it 'right'. 

I started to read about the UTF7 issue. It has not been included in the JDK. People have been asking Sun for SEVEN YEARS to implement it but they didn't. (See the bug database http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4304013).

There is an interesting project though called JUTF7 (http://jutf7.sourceforge.net). I downloaded it, it works. I even included a -testuris switch in the IMAP application, so that I could validate those URIs. It prooved difficult. In order to do it really correctly one would have to do the following:

1. Figure out which parts of the URI can contain non-ASCII characters that need to be escaped wihth UTF7. 
2. Use JUTF7 in the IMAPCrawler so that it prepares those URIS properly. I.e. MailUtil.convertStringToUTF7, note that this is tricky since a login can contain '@' (like antoni_mylka@fastmail.net which is the login to my test IMAP account) which need to be URL-Encoded whereas the folder names can contain ąęółłśśććżźć (Polish) or äöü etc. which need to be UTF7-encoded

3. Write a real public static boolean isImapUriValid in the MailUtil class, it would:

a. have a JavaCC grammar that would check the correctness of the URI (RFC 2192 contains a beautiful ABNF syntax specification).

b. check the appropriate parts for the presence of non-ASCII characters, if they are encoded correctly (URL-encoding in the login, UTF7 in the folder name)

All of this is quite a lot. I therefore open a new ticket and ask for comments.

I've been trying to dig through the IMAP crawler to determine where the
URIs are created. I found out that

a. folders are simple
String folderUrl = getFolderURIPrefix(folder) + ";TYPE=LIST";
around line 386

b. messages aren't that obvious, first the message itself is processed,
the message metadata contains links to the children of the message
(attachmets or other embedded MIME parts) they are inserted into the queue
and then the getObject method is called repeatedly, the first argument
(javax.mail.MimeMessage) stays the same, but the uri changes. The getObject
method when it is called the first time it creates a cachedDataObjects Map
and then with every subsequent call one data object from this map is
retrieved and returned.

The cachedDataObjectsMap is created from a list of data objects returned
by DataObjectFactory.createDataObjects method. That DataObjectFactory
receives the URI of the message from the IMAP crawler it creates URIS for
the parts and attachments by itself. The URI creation is sprinkled around
the entire DataObjectFactory class. I'll have to refactor it to make it
more obvious how are the uris created, to figure out what to do to make
them more RFC2192 compliant.

JUTF7 is good input, I didn'T find that library.

I would do it like this:
We have the problem two times:
* on creating the uris for crawled e-mails. Then its easy, you only encode
the names of the folders in the PATH using UTF7,
scheme://username:pwd@host/path --> only the <path> is to be UTF7

* when implementing dataAccessor. Then, you need to get the username from
the datasource (see the other ticket on desktop:Uri: we NEED a
canContainUri() method on the datasources). In dataAccessor, you use a
java.net.URI to parse the uri, and it should contain user, host, password,
protocol properly, the path can be transformed with UTF7.

Summary: Implement IMAP URI Validation

Initial Comment:
While working on the issue entitled '[ 1565163 ] IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant' I did some research about how to solve it 'right'. 

I started to read about the UTF7 issue. It has not been included in the JDK. People have been asking Sun for SEVEN YEARS to implement it but they didn't. (See the bug database http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4304013).

There is an interesting project though called JUTF7 (http://jutf7.sourceforge.net). I downloaded it, it works. I even included a -testuris switch in the IMAP application, so that I could validate those URIs. It prooved difficult. In order to do it really correctly one would have to do the following:

1. Figure out which parts of the URI can contain non-ASCII characters that need to be escaped wihth UTF7. 
2. Use JUTF7 in the IMAPCrawler so that it prepares those URIS properly. I.e. MailUtil.convertStringToUTF7, note that this is tricky since a login can contain '@' (like antoni_mylka@fastmail.net which is the login to my test IMAP account) which need to be URL-Encoded whereas the folder names can contain ąęółłśśććżźć (Polish) or äöü etc. which need to be UTF7-encoded

3. Write a real public static boolean isImapUriValid in the MailUtil class, it would:

a. have a JavaCC grammar that would check the correctness of the URI (RFC 2192 contains a beautiful ABNF syntax specification).

b. check the appropriate parts for the presence of non-ASCII characters, if they are encoded correctly (URL-encoding in the login, UTF7 in the folder name)

All of this is quite a lot. I therefore open a new ticket and ask for comments.

... and as far as JUTF7 is concerned the RFC2192 states explicitely that 

9. Multinational Considerations

     IMAP4 [IMAP4] section 5.1.3 includes a convention for encoding
     non-US-ASCII characters in IMAP mailbox names.  Because this
     convention is private to IMAP, it is necessary to convert IMAP's
     encoding to one that can be more easily interpreted by a URL
     display program.  For this reason, IMAP's modified UTF-7 encoding
     for mailboxes MUST be converted to UTF-8 [UTF8].  Since 8-bit
     characters are not permitted in URLs, the UTF-8 characters are

     encoded as required by the URL specification [BASIC-URL].  Sample
     code is included in Appendix A to demonstrate this conversion.

The C++ code attached to the RFC does a mixture of what URLEncoder and the
UTF7 charset implementation do, with the exception that slashes are not to
be encoded. It seems that javax.mail does some convesion behind the scenes,
so that the getName method of a Folder returns a normal UTF16 name with
non-ascii characters converted properly. This would allow us to bypass the
UTF7 problem altogether and do everything with URL-encoded UTF8 just as the
RFC states it MUST be done.

And the key question, how to test it. Or, more precisely, what do you
think is the sufficiently 'correct' way to test it, given the time
constraints we have.

Or? Any comments?

Summary: move  to semdesk uri scheme

Initial Comment:
We need to implement the semdesk hack that we had in mind in august.

The URI scheme is described here:

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/SemdeskUris

I changed the scheme to use domain names as application identifiers - comments?

changes need to be done to Outlook first, other things can wait. 

At the end, this won't take long, we just have to hardcode one string somewhere. "semdesk:"

btw: in the august discussion on uris schemes at ontology meeting in
KArlsruhe, we agreed to use desktop:// rather than semdesk://, as this is
generic on the desktop level.

for solution 1 I would rather do direct opener/accessor, its an impl
returning an impl:
2. public DataAccessorFactory DataSource.getDataAccessor()
3. public DataOpenerFactory DataSource.getDataOpener()

for solution 2, the hope is that accessors/openers work for desktop when
having registered prefixes.
I would rather go here for semi-standardized schemes, like kde://, where
the usual scheme-based registry works.

my main fear are complex datasources where the dataaccessor/opener needs
to know about the datasource. Such as flickr. They may be mapped to HTTP
uris using ontologies, and then accessor are completly not-standard,
(opener is) and may need the datasource to work (flickr needs api key,
perhaps username).
also, multiple email sources may have different ways of accessing the
resources.

We've had a little chat with Leo on Skype today. The constraints we are
trying to satisfy are:

1. Keep the current schemes intact, file://, http://, https:// should work
as expected, the same would apply to ftp://, webdav://, gopher etc.
2. The schemes that aren't stadardized (outlook:// etc.) should be
substituted with the semdesk:// scheme with appropriate prefixes. The
accessor, and opener registries should be adjusted.
3. It should be possible to distinguish between a generic accessor (http)
and a specific accessor (flickr).

We agreed that the basic prefix-processing is too little. It wouldn't
cover the http vs. https case etc. DataSource implementations must be
allowed to do more advanced URI parsing. That's why it's better to have a
canContainUri method.

Solution 1
1. public int DataSource.canContainUri - the implementation may or may not
take the information in the data source configuration into account. The
number returned is the number of the characters in the URI that make up the
necessary condition. For FileSystemDataSource we have
startsWith(rootFolder), for Web we have startsWith rootUrl, or fallsWithin
domain boundaries. It is impossible to set up a mathematically sound
contract for this method and the value should be used as a HINT as to
whether the data source CAN contain a resource. No guarantees are given. If
the URI violates some restriction (e.g. it is outside of the domain
boundaries), a negative value is returned.
2. public DataAccessorFactory DataSource.getDataAccessorFactory
3. public DataOpenerFactory DataSource.getDataOpenerFactory

Solution 2
1. public int DataSource.canContainUri - as above
2. public int DataAccessorFactory.canContainUri - unclear, only most basic
regex processing is permissible since the dataAccessorFactory doesn't have
access to the data source configuration
3. public int DataOpenerFactory.canContainUri - unclear, only most basic
regex processing is permissible since the dataAccessorFactory doesn't have
access to the data source configuration
Advantage: theoretically even without a data source a
semdesk://localhost/outlook uri may b e recognized by an
OutlookAccessorFactory
Disadvantage: theoretically cases may occur when an URI is recognized by a
DataSource, but is not recognized by any DataAccessorFactory, due to some
source-specific parts of the URI.  Can they? 

I would personally go for the second solution since I can't come up with
any meaningful examples when problems might occur. Does anyone have a
better idea?

we need it for desktop:
* desktop://outlook
* desktop://email
* desktop://thunderbird

the main goal is to minimize the non-standard behavior we have, making up
multiple imaginary desktop protocols is unhealthy. one imaginary protocol
"desktop" has the chance to be registered sometimes.

we also need it for web 2.0 applications:
* http://www.flickr.com/photos/*

We could write a special DataAccessor that reacts to these kind of online
uris, invoking a proper data extraction using the web apis or page
scraping
instead of just extracting the plaintext from the HTML.

Still, there is a problem of passing in the datasource, once a
DataAccessor is retrieved using the DataAccessorRegistry.get(String
scheme)
method, I cannot pass the right datasource to
DataAccessor.getDataObject(String url, DataSource source, Map params,
RDFContainerFactory containerFactory) throws UrlNotFoundException,
IOException;

The Outlook, Thunderbird, Flickr, etc DataAccessors would need the
correct
DataSource to know the password or other configuration options that are
not
encoded in the URI.
For this, I would again urge to add a "canContainURI(String uri)" method
to the DataSource interface, that returns true (or these 0-200 values)
indicating if it can contain a URI. we had this discussion before - where
is it documented?

problem is that some "schemes" can be part of a "prefix" also, I would
add
both functionalities to the dataaccessors to be on the save side, and
perhaps also add the possibility of regular expressions for uri parsing
(to
say "yes" both to http and https versions, etc).

No it's not. This will invalidate the OutlookAccessorFactory and
OutlookOpenerFactory, because there will be no 'outlook' URI scheme
anymore. This will have direct consequenses for Nepomuk Users, who need the
(access|refresh|open)Resource methods to work for Outlook resources. 

See the Nepomuk ticket no 78
http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/ticket/78
OlafGrebner kept bugging me about it.

The semdesk hack will necessitate a rewrite of aperture registries, so
that they won't work with uri SCHEMES (i.e. the part before the colon) but
with arbitrary uri PREFIXES (which may reach only to the first colon, but
may also go further (semdesk://localhost/outlook)). I would like to hear
some more comments before doing this.

Summary: Implement IMAP URI Validation

Initial Comment:
While working on the issue entitled '[ 1565163 ] IMAP URI\'s are not RFC 2192 compliant' I did some research about how to solve it 'right'. 

I started to read about the UTF7 issue. It has not been included in the JDK. People have been asking Sun for SEVEN YEARS to implement it but they didn't. (See the bug database http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4304013).

There is an interesting project though called JUTF7 (http://jutf7.sourceforge.net). I downloaded it, it works. I even included a -testuris switch in the IMAP application, so that I could validate those URIs. It prooved difficult. In order to do it really correctly one would have to do the following:

1. Figure out which parts of the URI can contain non-ASCII characters that need to be escaped wihth UTF7. 
2. Use JUTF7 in the IMAPCrawler so that it prepares those URIS properly. I.e. MailUtil.convertStringToUTF7, note that this is tricky since a login can contain '@' (like antoni_mylka@fastmail.net which is the login to my test IMAP account) which need to be URL-Encoded whereas the folder names can contain ąęółłśśććżźć (Polish) or äöü etc. which need to be UTF7-encoded

3. Write a real public static boolean isImapUriValid in the MailUtil class, it would:

a. have a JavaCC grammar that would check the correctness of the URI (RFC 2192 contains a beautiful ABNF syntax specification).

b. check the appropriate parts for the presence of non-ASCII characters, if they are encoded correctly (URL-encoding in the login, UTF7 in the folder name)

All of this is quite a lot. I therefore open a new ticket and ask for comments.

given the time constrainst and the look on the standard:

two cases, A is generating URIs for folders/emails, B is parsing URIs
passed to dataaccessor, dataopener and use JavaMail to get the mail
identified. I think we ignore B for the moment, but if we look at B, we
should somehow be able to cope with either UTF8 or UTF7 parts in URIs.

For generating URIS (A) I cannot judge the situation completly, but
looking at the RFC and knowing from past problems, UTF-8 encoding in URIs
is better than the crazy IMAP UTF-7 encoding. The Javadoc also says to use
UTF-8 whereever possible, referring to a w3c reco.

9. Multinational Considerations

     IMAP4 [IMAP4] section 5.1.3 includes a convention for encoding
     non-US-ASCII characters in IMAP mailbox names.  Because this
     convention is private to IMAP, it is necessary to convert IMAP's
     encoding to one that can be more easily interpreted by a URL
     display program.  For this reason, IMAP's modified UTF-7 encoding
     for mailboxes MUST be converted to UTF-8 [UTF8].  Since 8-bit
     characters are not permitted in URLs, the UTF-8 characters are

     encoded as required by the URL specification [BASIC-URL].  Sample
     code is included in Appendix A to demonstrate this conversion.

The C++ code attached to the RFC does a mixture of what URLEncoder and the
UTF7 charset implementation do, with the exception that slashes are not to
be encoded. It seems that javax.mail does some convesion behind the scenes,
so that the getName method of a Folder returns a normal UTF16 name with
non-ascii characters converted properly. This would allow us to bypass the
UTF7 problem altogether and do everything with URL-encoded UTF8 just as the
RFC states it MUST be done.

And the key question, how to test it. Or, more precisely, what do you
think is the sufficiently 'correct' way to test it, given the time
constraints we have.

Or? Any comments?

I've been trying to dig through the IMAP crawler to determine where the
URIs are created. I found out that

a. folders are simple
String folderUrl = getFolderURIPrefix(folder) + ";TYPE=LIST";
around line 386

b. messages aren't that obvious, first the message itself is processed,
the message metadata contains links to the children of the message
(attachmets or other embedded MIME parts) they are inserted into the queue
and then the getObject method is called repeatedly, the first argument
(javax.mail.MimeMessage) stays the same, but the uri changes. The getObject
method when it is called the first time it creates a cachedDataObjects Map
and then with every subsequent call one data object from this map is
retrieved and returned.

The cachedDataObjectsMap is created from a list of data objects returned
by DataObjectFactory.createDataObjects method. That DataObjectFactory
receives the URI of the message from the IMAP crawler it creates URIS for
the parts and attachments by itself. The URI creation is sprinkled around
the entire DataObjectFactory class. I'll have to refactor it to make it
more obvious how are the uris created, to figure out what to do to make
them more RFC2192 compliant.

JUTF7 is good input, I didn'T find that library.

I would do it like this:
We have the problem two times:
* on creating the uris for crawled e-mails. Then its easy, you only encode
the names of the folders in the PATH using UTF7,
scheme://username:pwd@host/path --> only the <path> is to be UTF7

* when implementing dataAccessor. Then, you need to get the username from
the datasource (see the other ticket on desktop:Uri: we NEED a
canContainUri() method on the datasources). In dataAccessor, you use a
java.net.URI to parse the uri, and it should contain user, host, password,
protocol properly, the path can be transformed with UTF7.

So. I've looked around the code. The uris generated by the crawler are in
URL-Encoded UTF-8. Assuming that javax.mail does the conversion behind the
scenes and the folder.getName method returns the actual name already
converted to UTF-16 (as all java strings), the
URLEncoder.encode(string,"UTF-8") generates uri parts that conform to the
RFC. The two other issues mentioned that is:

1. An extended parser of the uris passed to the
DataAccessor.getObjectMethod, so that it allows for URL-Encoded UTF-8 uris
and URL-encoded UTF7-IMAP uris, (or maybe even uris with normal UTF7-IMAP
without URL-encoding) would need to employ some heuristic to determine what
encoding is used. Doing it right, so that it performs reasonably well in a
broad range of cases is non-trivial.

2. The real URI validation, that is take a string and tell if it is a
valid RFC2192-compliant URL with folder names using URL-Encoded UTF-8
codes.

I guess the best way would be to write a utility class called IMAPUri,
that would have get/set methods for the login name, password, list of
folder names etc. It would allow the creation of URIS with API calls, - not
string concatenation. It would perform all conversions and have a toString
and toUri methods. It would also have a proper validator. This is
non-trivial and in my opinion non-critical at the moment. Therefore, since
the original problem reported by jwus in the ticket number 1565163 has been
solved, I postpone this issue until after the release.

Summary: Listening crawlers architecture - first draft

Initial Comment:
Current Aperture crawlers need to be fired every now and then to detect new/modified/deleted data objects in a data source. It would be nice to have listening crawlers that would use whatever means necessary (including native libraries) to obtain notifications about changes in a data source.

Chris:
I always though of this as just another bunch of Crawler implementations, but perhaps a different API is warrented. Will it also use the CrawlerHandler API, or does it require its own dedicated callback API? If so, how does it relate to CrawlerHandler (sub- or super-interface, common parent interface)? After all, both entities will want to report changed, new and removed objects.

Antoni: 
maybe the idea is to crawl first and then listen for changes. It is possible to implement this in the same class or extend existing interfaces.

Chris: 
it maybe close to a crawler but may request some small changes. The semantics of Start/Stop would be different. This would also mean connecting to native APIs through JNI, to inotify and to shell32. Libraries with native code should go into separate artifact.

suggestion:
Make two sub-interfaces Crawler, possible names: BatchCrawler, ContinousCrawler,
extend Crawler and CrawlerHandler

Action:
Leo asks DFKI people for how we did it before.
Antoni then implements it
We discuss about integration when its done - we start experimenting it in a separate project

Summary: Support special XML extractors based on DTD/XSD/NS

Initial Comment:
We live in a world of XML formats-horray!

Aperture does not convert XML formats to proper semantic RDF counterparts, it would be needed to:

make special type of Extractors that work on XML FileDataObjects (not necessarily getting SAX as input, but at least saying to support XML parsing)
Chris: I think these Extractors should still work on an InputStream: the choice whether to use SAX, DOM, XPATH, regular expressions or black magic is still best made on a case-by-case basis.

analyse .xml files to detect what data is inside: identify xml document type by Document Type Definition (DTD), XML Schema definitions (XSD), or declared Namespaces in the root element
Chris: this requires considerable work in the current MIME type identifier, or perhaps even a different MimeTypeIdentifier implementation that is invoked when the MagicMimeTypeIdentifier identifies a document as text/xml or application/xml. Right now the former tries to handle specific cases of XML-based document types using file extensions, which clearly is very brittle. I think Tika also has support for detecting XML-based document types, we should take a look at it.
invoke XML Extractors that are registered by their xml document type

Problems:

what is the URI of the reported data object when having XML data?
When crawling complex XML files, such as RDF files, what is the reported URI in the single returned DataObject?
Chris: the DataObject representing the entire file should always have the URI of that file IMO. When a file needs to be broken down in multiple DataObjects, we should always use a SubCrawler, also because the AccessData needs to include the URIs of these sub-DataObjects (necessary for incremental crawling).
When the file gets too big, where is the border to SubCrawlers?
Some XML files may contain MANY documents/dataobjects, then a subcrawler would be better (See below). What is a good rule-of-thumb to determinem when to use a subcrawler and when to use an XML extractor?
Chris: as said above, I would let SubCrawler be the only implementation that produces additional DataObjects, Extractor should just populate a single DataObject (or its RDFContainer, actually). I can't think of a definitive guideline of when to use a SubCrawler or an Extractor. I think that you want a SubCrawler when the parts to represent as individual DataObjects each have their own "life cycle" (are added/deleted/edited independently) and/or when end-user apps are likely to represent these DataObjects as first-class citizens.

Proposed solutions:

either:

extend the MimetypeRegistry to include xml types. Maybe most xml types can be represented as mimetypes
build a new registry for XML types
new mime-type detection needed?

create a new MimetypeIdentifier implementation that extracts both MimetypeIdentifier and XML detection, maybe added to the magicnumber-based mimetype identifiers or as separate class. Maybe hide the XML detection as a class referenced from the MimetypeIdentifier

new registry for special XML-handlers needed?
we base our registry based on mimetypes and use the existing mimetype registry

for additional cases we make a registry to map the URIs of DTDs, namespaces, XSD types to mimetypes they correspond to. not part of core API.

no new interface is needed for the XML exctractors (we may implement an abstract XML extractor that does SAX or something)

implement the extractors "in the wild" and look for abstractions later.

Actions:

Chris to look into how to extend the MimetypeIdentifier. Extends the MagicMimetypeIdentifiers

Antoni & Leo: find example of XML files that we want to handle and put them in the test documents folder

Summary: Listening crawlers architecture - first draft

Initial Comment:
Current Aperture crawlers need to be fired every now and then to detect new/modified/deleted data objects in a data source. It would be nice to have listening crawlers that would use whatever means necessary (including native libraries) to obtain notifications about changes in a data source.

Chris:
I always though of this as just another bunch of Crawler implementations, but perhaps a different API is warrented. Will it also use the CrawlerHandler API, or does it require its own dedicated callback API? If so, how does it relate to CrawlerHandler (sub- or super-interface, common parent interface)? After all, both entities will want to report changed, new and removed objects.

Antoni: 
maybe the idea is to crawl first and then listen for changes. It is possible to implement this in the same class or extend existing interfaces.

Chris: 
it maybe close to a crawler but may request some small changes. The semantics of Start/Stop would be different. This would also mean connecting to native APIs through JNI, to inotify and to shell32. Libraries with native code should go into separate artifact.

suggestion:
Make two sub-interfaces Crawler, possible names: BatchCrawler, ContinousCrawler,
extend Crawler and CrawlerHandler

Action:
Leo asks DFKI people for how we did it before.
Antoni then implements it
We discuss about integration when its done - we start experimenting it in a separate project

This issue is a never-ending one. Therefore I've created a wiki page for
it:

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/ListeningToChangesInDataSources

So the actual tasks can be rephrased as:
Leo: 
1. ask DFKI people how we did it before
2. Write it on the wiki page
3. Reassign the task to Antoni

Antoni
4. Create appropriate interfaces and document them
5. Try to write some listening crawler
6. (work out a way embed it in the Nepomuk UI - optional)
7. Update the wiki page with the insights you gained
8. Close the ticket 

Everyone
9. Look at this and see if it is good.

This issue is a never-ending one, I've created a wiki page for it, it will
have better visibility.

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/XMLExtractorsBasedOnDTDorXSDorNS

So the task is.
1. Think about the architecture, how to extend the
MagicMimeTypeIdentifier
2. Write these thoughts on the wiki page
3. Change/create the apropriate interfaces and document them (if
necessary)
4. Write one or two example implementations of XML extractors
5. Update the wiki page (if anything changed)
6. Close the ticket.

Summary: Release Aperture 1.0 beta 1

Initial Comment:
The code seems to be very stable now and the APIs haven't changed a bit recently. There are ideas for API improvements (extended CrawlerHandler, SubCrawler, Extractor) but those are not likely to happen any time soon, so I propose to move to a 1.0 release now and save those improvements for a 2.0 release.

First target: get a 1.0 beta 1 release out of the door before ISWC.

Summary: java.io.File - based extractors

Initial Comment:
This issue is described on a wiki page

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/FileBasedExtractors

The task is:
1. make a new interface FileExtractor with one mehtod that is the same as with extractor but with a java.io.File instead of inputstream
2. we extend ExtractorRegistry to also register FileExctractors. add method "getFileExctractor" (or how its called)
3. we add a method getFile() to FileDataObject, which does:
4. download the inputstream to a temp-file if only stream exists, or return a new InputStream from the file object
5. add a constructor to FileDataObject allowing a File as input
6. the FileDataObject.dispose() method deletes the possibly created temp-file
7. update the appropriate javadocs
8. update the wikipage

I've started to play around with this ticket. It turns out that the
generation of the temporary file must be placed on the shoulders of the
user. Consider the following:

1. The FileDataObject is created with an InputStream
2. The user obtains the input stream with the getContent method
3. ... and passes it to a MimeType identifier
4. the MimeTypeIdentifier determines a mime type for which only a
FileExtractor is available
5. the user calls getFile
6. the getFile method takes the stream and tries to create a temp file

But it breaks because the input stream has already been passed to a
MimeTypeIdentifier, some bytes were read from the stream, possibly the
mark/reset methods have been called. The FileDataObject cannot rewind the
stream to the beginning. Theoretically it could mark the begginning, in
getContent method but then the user would not be able to use mark/reset at
all. I think it's crappy. Therefore I placed a comment that the user should
use IOUtil.writeStream(inputStream, file) method. It is then his problem
how to deal with mark/reset problem.

Summary: Adding a part frame doesn't work

Initial Comment:
I use KID3 for windows, version 0.10, qt 4.3.2. I'm preparing a small file that would contain all ID3v2 frames known to mankind. 

I've created a file (attached). It already contains some ID3v2 frames. I've been adding them from top to bottom. Now, when I try to add the Part frame, the program halts. I happen to have Visual Studio installed, the debugger doesn't have the sources, so the only thing it can show is the disassembly and the stack trace.

The disassembly of the spot that causes the error (some leading and some trailing lines have been included)

Summary: Adding a part frame doesn't work

Initial Comment:
I use KID3 for windows, version 0.10, qt 4.3.2. I'm preparing a small file that would contain all ID3v2 frames known to mankind. 

I've created a file (attached). It already contains some ID3v2 frames. I've been adding them from top to bottom. Now, when I try to add the Part frame, the program halts. I happen to have Visual Studio installed, the debugger doesn't have the sources, so the only thing it can show is the disassembly and the stack trace.

The disassembly of the spot that causes the error (some leading and some trailing lines have been included)

Thanks for the bug report.
The crash is also reproducible with Linux, and it occurs in id3lib:

#0  0xb7ec096a in ID3_FrameHeader::SetFrameID () from
/usr/lib/libid3-3.8.so.3
#1  0xb7ebe58f in ID3_FrameImpl::_SetID () from /usr/lib/libid3-3.8.so.3
#2  0xb7ebe5f3 in ID3_FrameImpl::SetID () from /usr/lib/libid3-3.8.so.3
#3  0xb7ebea7d in ID3_FrameImpl::ID3_FrameImpl () from
/usr/lib/libid3-3.8.so.3
#4  0xb7ebded5 in ID3_Frame::ID3_Frame () from /usr/lib/libid3-3.8.so.3
#5  0x0809e441 in Mp3File::addFrameV2 (this=0x824b388, frame=@0x81f153c)
at ../../kid3/kid3/mp3file.cpp:1524
		ID3_Frame* id3Frame = new ID3_Frame(id);
(gdb) p id
$1 = ID3FID_SETSUBTITLE

...

bool ID3_FrameHeader::SetFrameID(ID3_FrameID id)
{
  if (id == ID3FID_NOFRAME || id == this->GetFrameID())
  {
    return false;
  }
  _frame_def = ID3_FindFrameDef(id);
  _flags.set(TAGALTER, _frame_def->bTagDiscard);

NULL is returned for _frame_def, then it is dereferenced -> segfault

Although ID3FID_SETSUBTITLE is defined in id3lib, it is not supported by
id3lib, because the TSST frame was introduced in ID3v2.4.0
(id3v2.4-changes.txt, 5. New frames, TSST Set subtitle [F:4.2.1]). Kid3
should avoid such frames.

Workaround: Never add a TSST frame ("Part") to ID3v2.3.0 frames

A patch is available at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1850341&group_id=70849&atid=529223

Summary: java.io.File - based extractors

Initial Comment:
This issue is described on a wiki page

http://aperture.wiki.sourceforge.net/FileBasedExtractors

The task is:
1. make a new interface FileExtractor with one mehtod that is the same as with extractor but with a java.io.File instead of inputstream
2. we extend ExtractorRegistry to also register FileExctractors. add method "getFileExctractor" (or how its called)
3. we add a method getFile() to FileDataObject, which does:
4. download the inputstream to a temp-file if only stream exists, or return a new InputStream from the file object
5. add a constructor to FileDataObject allowing a File as input
6. the FileDataObject.dispose() method deletes the possibly created temp-file
7. update the appropriate javadocs
8. update the wikipage

downloading anything

I've started to play around with this ticket. It turns out that the
generation of the temporary file must be placed on the shoulders of the
user. Consider the following:

1. The FileDataObject is created with an InputStream
2. The user obtains the input stream with the getContent method
3. ... and passes it to a MimeType identifier
4. the MimeTypeIdentifier determines a mime type for which only a
FileExtractor is available
5. the user calls getFile
6. the getFile method takes the stream and tries to create a temp file

But it breaks because the input stream has already been passed to a
MimeTypeIdentifier, some bytes were read from the stream, possibly the
mark/reset methods have been called. The FileDataObject cannot rewind the
stream to the beginning. Theoretically it could mark the begginning, in
getContent method but then the user would not be able to use mark/reset at
all. I think it's crappy. Therefore I placed a comment that the user should
use IOUtil.writeStream(inputStream, file) method. It is then his problem
how to deal with mark/reset problem.

Summary: Bugs in the GEO property handling

Initial Comment:
Section 3.4.2 of RFC 2426 states that:

Type value: A single structured value consisting of two float values separated by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

Whereas the GEOItemHandler class, lines 41-43

String[] comps =
StringUtil.split(item.getDecodedValue(), ",");
geo.setLatitude(Double.parseDouble(comps[0]));
geo.setLongitude(Double.parseDouble(comps[1]));

It should be a SEMI-COLON, not a comma in the split method.

The second problem is that GEO values are stored as doubles, this is wrong, it breaks when the GEO values have more than five decimal digits. Exactly the same problem has already occured with ical4j library, the maintainer changed the internal representation to BigDecimal. It might be a good idea to do the same here. A big decimal can always be converted to a double if needed

The attached file is parsed wrong. It has been generated by the KDE Kontact. The encoded data of the photo property is (after unfolding) 26112 chars long. The Base64 class throws an exception because the next line REV: is NOT parsed as a separate property, but is concatenated to the PHOTO value.

Summary: Remove the xerces and xalan dependency.

Initial Comment:
It shouldn't be too difficult to remove the dependency on xerces and xalan and instead use the javax.xml and javax.xml.transform interfaces. The implementations are included in the modern versions of JDK, this would make it easier to embed mime-dir-j-vcard4j.

Summary: Bugs in the GEO property handling

Initial Comment:
Section 3.4.2 of RFC 2426 states that:

Type value: A single structured value consisting of two float values separated by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

Whereas the GEOItemHandler class, lines 41-43

String[] comps =
StringUtil.split(item.getDecodedValue(), ",");
geo.setLatitude(Double.parseDouble(comps[0]));
geo.setLongitude(Double.parseDouble(comps[1]));

It should be a SEMI-COLON, not a comma in the split method.

The second problem is that GEO values are stored as doubles, this is wrong, it breaks when the GEO values have more than five decimal digits. Exactly the same problem has already occured with ical4j library, the maintainer changed the internal representation to BigDecimal. It might be a good idea to do the same here. A big decimal can always be converted to a double if needed

Summary: Parser bug with the PHOTO property

Initial Comment:
The attached file is parsed wrong. It has been generated by the KDE Kontact. The encoded data of the photo property is (after unfolding) 26112 chars long. The Base64 class throws an exception because the next line REV: is NOT parsed as a separate property, but is concatenated to the PHOTO value.

attached a patch that fixes the problem (as far as the attached file is
concerned), this fix will work (i.e. an attachment and the following line
will be parsed correctly) in most cases, it will fail under following
conditions
1. the base64 encoding of the attachment fits in a single line (which is
highly unlikely)
2. there were no occurences of "normal" folding before (which is also
quite unlikely)

Summary: Exposes the last modification date of an MboxFolder

Initial Comment:
This patch exposes the last modification date of an MboxFolder to the application. It would be very useful for the Aperture framework. It would allow the MboxCrawler to detect if a folder has been modified or not without having to store the information about the exact content of a folder and to check it all between crawls.

Initial Comment:
I'm running a FileSystemCrawler over a folder full of email files. I get the plainTextContent delivered by the MimeExtractor. It contains both the plainText mime part AND the HTML mime part concatenated together, which sucks big time

By: charanya

While crawling the file system I often land-up with an error “DataObject has
not been disposed.”. Altough it comes as a warning as per log, it stops the
crawling. We are peresently using Aperture “aperture-2006.1-alpha-3a”.

When dug into the same the error seems to be triggred from
“DataObjectBase.class”
We create data object for each file while crawling, using the native aperture
method. We dispose these objects once the crawling is comeplete. It seems there
could be a few data objects that are not disposed & hence memory problems could
be triggering this action.

Please help…

I've applied this patch, however I'm not sure how you will be able to use
it without gaining access to the folder delegate of an MstorFolder. Does
this also require a method in MstorFolder?

ben

I've applied this patch, but I think you may require an additional method in
MstorFolder to use it..

Note that you could also call FolderDelegate.getLastUid(), which returns the
last UID allocated for delegates that support UID allocation (currently this
is only MetaFolder, which is enabled using the META_ENABLED flag).

regards,
ben

Hi Jason,

I think I've finally fixed this one. I am now adjusting the position of the
message buffer to exclude the From_ line.

Changes are available in CVS. Apologies for taking so long. :)

regards,
ben

Hi Christopher,

I think the real problem here is that JavaMail doesn't seem very forgiving when
it comes to parsing messages headers.

Providers such as mstor are primarily responsible for providing a message input
stream - including headers - that JavaMail then parses. I have seen similar
problems before with message headers, and I think the proper way to deal with
it would be to contact the JavaMail developers.

I also think the reason it is working via IMAP is that the implementation is
different (MimeMessage vs. IMAPMessage), so there's probably some processing
specific to the IMAP implementation that removes the whitespaces.

That said, I haven't really found out how easy it is to submit patches for JavaMail
yet, but I think the project is now based here:

https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/mail/

The only other solution I can think of is to perhaps override the implementation
in MimeMessage to remove the whitespaces, altho it seems a bit of a hack.. I
might look at it anyway. :)

regards,
ben

Hi Christopher,

Yeah it's a pretty big limitation of the mbox file format that it doesn't support
retrieval of received date.

The way JavaMail is implemented is that by default the MimeMessage implementation
will simply return null for calls to getReceivedDate(). It is up to the store
implementation to override this method to return something meaningful. Unfortunately
because mbox does not provide a mechanism for returning the received date we
need to provide additional metadata for storing this information.

If you don't want to rely on any metadata approach you could alternatively call
getSentDate(), which will read the "Date" header from the message, however this
isn't a very reliable method of determining when a message was actually
received.

regards,
ben

Hi Rich,

I've just applied a few fixes to the regex used in the From_ patterns and also
increased the default buffer size to 8192. Results are looking promising so
far, however it may still require some more tweaking (I am not very confident
in my regex abilities..). :)

regards,
ben

To be honest, I don't see how this patch would work. It looks like you are trying
to open the .msf file as an mbox file. But the msf format seems to be some kind
of mork file database..

Anyway, unfortunately the code for mstor has change quite significantly since
this patch was submitted, so there's no easy way to see what the patch is really
trying to do (I can't really figure it out without indentation, etc.).

regards,
ben

Initial Comment:
PerformanceMeasuringCrawlerHandler has a private nrObjects variable, as does its superclass SimpleCrawlerHandler. The value is incremented in the overridden objectNew method, meaning that only the value in the subclass is incremented. This way, SimpleCrawlerHandler.accessingObject will always point to an untouched variable and several of the statistics calculated at the end are incorrect.

nrObjects (and possibly other vars as well) should probably be protected, so that only a single instance of this variable is sufficient.

on difference I observed is 
TZOFFSETFROM:+0530 
TZOFFSETTO:+0630 

where as from outlook 
TZOFFSETFROM:+0530 
TZOFFSETTO:+0530 

This could be a reason for outlook not processing this properly.

When I try to create a daily recurring event and send a mail containing this
event, in outlook it is not shown as an event.

1. initially i tried with out adding VTimeZone to Calendar, in this case it
shows as a meeting in outlook but recurrence is ignored by outlook.

2. I have exported from .ics from outlook for a daily recurring event there
I found that VTimeZone is there in Calendar

3. now after adding VTimeZone to Calendar, the out put from ical4j for VTimeZone
tag is
BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
TZID:Asia/Calcutta
X-LIC-LOCATION:Asia/Calcutta
BEGIN:STANDARD
TZOFFSETFROM:+055328
TZOFFSETTO:+055320
TZNAME:HMT
DTSTART:18800101T000000
RDATE:18800101T000000
END:STANDARD
BEGIN:STANDARD
TZOFFSETFROM:+055320
TZOFFSETTO:+0630
TZNAME:BURT
DTSTART:19410930T233640
RDATE:19410930T233640
END:STANDARD
BEGIN:STANDARD
TZOFFSETFROM:+0630
TZOFFSETTO:+0530
TZNAME:IST
DTSTART:19420515T000000
RDATE:19420515T000000
RDATE:19451015T000000
END:STANDARD
BEGIN:DAYLIGHT
TZOFFSETFROM:+0530
TZOFFSETTO:+0630
TZNAME:IST
DTSTART:19420901T000000
RDATE:19420901T000000
END:DAYLIGHT
END:VTIMEZONE

Where as from .ics of outlook I see 
BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
TZID:Chennai\, Kolkata\, Mumbai\, New Delhi
BEGIN:STANDARD
DTSTART:16010101T000000
TZOFFSETFROM:+0530
TZOFFSETTO:+0530
END:STANDARD
END:VTIMEZONE

Now this is not shown as an event at all, it is just shown as an email
in outlook.

How this should be solved.

Wanted to try out reminder part of ical4j with outlook.
I tried 2 different things..
1. created event using ical4j added VAlarm
so that the content looks some thing like
.......
.......
BEGIN:VALARM
TRIGGER:-PT1H
REPEAT:4
ACTION:DISPLAY
DESCRIPTION:sample alarm....
END:VALARM
.......
....... 
in this case outlook does not show up the reminder when appropriate time comes.

2. created a recurring event from outlook and saved it in .ics format which
looks like
.....
.....
BEGIN:VALARM
TRIGGER:-PT15M
ACTION:DISPLAY
DESCRIPTION:Reminder
END:VALARM
....
....
Now also when I send this from a mail sending program, outlook does not show
up the reminder when appropriate time has come.

Is this the problem with outlook? can any one confirm?

Summary: UID treatment

Initial Comment:
I'm using jpim to write a vcard crawler for the Aperture Framework. I've just noticed an issue with the treatment of the UID property.

1. There is no UIDItemHandler - the UID elements are ignored when unmarshalling contacts. Every time a contact is unmarshalled - it has a new identifier.

2. The AbstractIdentifiable.setUID method accepts only uid strings that begin with "jpim-" - even if there were an UIDItemHandler UID's that weren't alloted by jpim would be ignored.

Aperture depends on the UIDs to create URIs for contacts. 

1. We must retain the UID's that are present in existing vcard files. Aperture cannot change the files because they are managed by external applications.

2. The UID's must not change between invocations of the unmarshaller, because we keep track of the identifiers we know to detect additions, modifications and deletions.

I'd be willing to contribute a patch. I would imagine it as some kind of an additional flag in the unmarshaller, or in the IO factory that would override the current behavior and 
1. allow for null uids
2. ensure that existing uids are unchanged and that they are returned when getUID() is invoked.

An UIDItemHandler would also be necessary.

Of course the current behaviour would be the default one and would not change.

Please tell me if it's possible.

This is important for us.

Summary: Exposes the last modification date of an MboxFolder

Initial Comment:
This patch exposes the last modification date of an MboxFolder to the application. It would be very useful for the Aperture framework. It would allow the MboxCrawler to detect if a folder has been modified or not without having to store the information about the exact content of a folder and to check it all between crawls.

I've applied this patch, however I'm not sure how you will be able to use
it without gaining access to the folder delegate of an MstorFolder. Does
this also require a method in MstorFolder?

regards,
ben

We have a few doubts regarding Aperture

1.While crawling a datasource (File Server) which order is followed (for instance.,by
size, lastmodifieddate of the file etc..)
2. What is the best method to dispose a data object. Should we use object.dispose()
method to dispose?

If the dispose function is disposing all the data objects.  then, i assume that
it is utilizing all the memory allocated by creating new dataobject for each
file without disposing the created objects, and when it has utilized all the
memory it throws a warning 'Data object has not been disposed'. We get this
warning inspite of including the dispose method inside the finally clause..
Please let me know if my understanding is right?

For your Information, 

1.We dont get any exceptions or OutofMemoryErrors..
2.The crawler is running in a seperate thread. It does not halt the entire
application, only the crawling stops.
3.The file types which we crawl are pdf,text files,html,MS Office files.

The warning which we got is,

DataObject has not been disposed. URI: , <Any file URL, followed by> From DataSource:
null [../../Java]

  In Oracle Calendar, it appears to be possible to invite what are termed 'external
attendees', who have no registered email addresses with the calendar server.

  The PARTSTAT (participation status) parameter of the ATTENDEE property in
VEVENTS from that calendaring service can contain an empty mailto: address,
e.g.:

ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE;CN=Joe Shlabotnik;PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION:mailto:

  When attempting to create a new Calendar object from an iCalendar string obtained
from that service, via CalendarBuilder.build() with either a Reader or InputStream,
a parsing error occurs with a message similar to "Expected scheme-specific part
at index 7: mailto:".

  Within a Calendar object, it would seem straightforward to iterate through
a list of attendees, get each attendee's calendar address, and for any attendee
where Attendee.getCalAddress() returns a mailto: scheme and an empty scheme-specific
part, set their email address to a default local address that doesn't accept
deliveries, for instance.  However, is there a best practices way to repair
empty mailto: addresses prior to parsing, or perhaps a way to relax parsing
to avoid throwing an exception on this type of invalid iCalendar data
(*shudder*)?

  One workaround might be to use regular expressions to repair those empty attendee
email addresses prior to parsing; this is to ask whether Ben or others might
recommend a different approach.

Thanks!
Aron

Hi,

I am tring to use iCal4j for one of my project. I am facing some issues in it-

1. I have to find that if the Calendar has a period for the future date.
2. I have to find the last occurance of the VEvent.
3. I have to retrive a periodlist exclusively.For example, in a VEvent, I have-
   DTSTART:20080310T083000Z
   DTEND:20080310T113000Z
   RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20080320
   To retrive the periods out of this vevent I have called-
   vEvent.getConsumedTime(fromTime, untill);
   Here, fromTime is 20080301 and untill is 20080330
   It gives me period list for 20080310 to 20080319 and not for 20080320.

It will be very greatful if someone can help me.

Thanks,
Manish

Hi

I've been away from my iCal related project for some months and when i now run
the previously happy code (which pulls down lots of Google public calendars)
i get lots of errors.

By searching in the calendar files i find it is a problem parsing RECURRENCE-ID
with a YYYYMMDD (only) format.

Suspecting it may have been fixed i updated from beta 3 to 4 - but no joy.

I have searched these formats and found an old reference to the same problem
from 2004 (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2598091">her
e</a>) and it seems the position then was that this is not the correct format
for it (should be "RECURRENCE-ID;VALUE=DATE:20040603")

As this seems to have changed in the past few months (inside the Google calendars)
can anyone suggest a way round it?

Here are a couple that now break iCal4j but were ok last year:

http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/canadian__en_gb%40holiday.calendar.google.co
m/public/basic.ics
http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/singapore__en_gb%40holiday.calendar.google.c
om/public/basic.ics

Hope there's a clue somewhere...

jonny B

What - no edit button?

"I have searched these formats and found..." should read
"I have searched these forums and found..." of course
