    *Thursday, 6-December-2007* - Professor Mark Musen, Head of
the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (formerly
Stanford Medical Informatics) and Principal Investigator of the
National Center for Biomedical Ontology research consortium,
giving a talk on: "If we build it, will they come?
Social-engineering of new technology to disseminate biomedical
ontologies." ... Please refer to details at the session wiki page
at:

http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2007_12_06
	

    *Abstract* - The National Center for Biomedical Ontology is
developing a wide range of Web-based services to assist end users
in browsing, evaluation, and use of ontologies. These features
include capabilities for which there is no specific correlate in
current technology for ontology management. These features
include online community-based review and annotation of
ontologies, support for declaring mappings between ontologies,
and the push of information about ontology changes directly to a
user's desktop. These novel capabilities for ontology access and
use have the potential to address pressing end-user needs and to
engage entire research communities in the development, evolution,
and evaluation of controlled terminologies and ontologies. Our
work offers possibilities for the creation of a new kind of
collaborative, community-based approach to the dissemination and
use of ontologies. The key question is whether our user community
is ready for such capabilities. The issue is one of sociology and
culture as much as it is one of technology. This talk will
describe the BioPortal for access to biomedical ontologies
online, and will outline our future plans for this novel,
Web-based resource.


    *RSVP* by by emailing me at <peter.yim@cim3.com> offline so
