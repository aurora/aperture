A test message that contains a forwarded message. The forwarded message 
references other messages. The extracted rdf should contain all this

Hi Mikhail,

the original question I need feedback on (extended)
* if there is another standardized way to solve this - how does KDE
solve it?
* How did microsoft plan to do it with WinFS? any experience?
* would you like to join the task-force TF-Ont-Id to work on this?
* Do you think we should develop this as Nepomuk standard or a W3C standard?



(now the XRI side-track:)

I think we need a desktop scheme, not a web-scheme, we need a 
non-HTTP-BASED uri scheme, because on the desktop you usually don't have 
a HTTP service running, and  http has some issues when used on the 
desktop (arguments below in original post)

I have looked at XRI last year, while writing "Cool URIs for the 
Semantic Web" and I share the opinion of Thompson and Orchard about XRI 
(a draft):
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/URNsAndRegistries-50

"We have shown that |http:| identifiers for XRIs can achieve the goals 
of XRI with substation benefits. The XRI goals of persistent identifiers 
and location independence are already available with |http:| 
identifiers. There are two concrete benefits to using XRIs identified in 
the previous analysis: that users cannot waste time by erroneously 
dereferencing namespace names that do not have namespace documents, and 
that an extra HTTP GET request is avoided when documents move. The XRI 
identifier solution's downsides are adding a new identifier scheme with 
the software and human costs and seemingly mandatory increased network 
costs ( our example shows 2 HTTP GETs instead of 1). Given these costs 
and benefits, deploying a new registrar, resolution mechanism and 
related software to layer on top of existing web functionality is not 
justified*.*"

basically, XRI is adding complexity to HTTP uris.

And this also counts for most other invented URI schemes, refer to  
"URNsAndRegistries-50" for good arguments.
I add a note into the RFC draft in our SVN that we don't use XRI because 
of this.

thanks for the pointers,
this question will pop up again,

Leo

>
>
>     Introduction
>     we cannot use RFC1738 because they are not capture there, we
>     cannot use "info:"
>     http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4452.txt because they are not to
>     be registered,
>     and we cannot use "urn:" http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt
>     because our
>     identifiers are location dependent.
>
>     We cannot use HTTP URIs, because desktops have
>     changing DNS names, so the URI will change once you switch
>     network. And
>     HTTP uris are not retrievable for desktop pcs. Even with the hacks we
>     thought of, it is not clean. The HTTP port for a desktop may be
>     blocked
>     or multiple users on one machine may collide ports.
>     Also, opening an http server on the desktop may be a security risk
>     in #

>
>     1. The "semdesk" URI scheme
>     Semantic Desktop URIs have several parts, including an application
>     specific part,
>     hostname information and a path within the application's namespace.
>     The name "semdesk" stems from the requirement to identify
>     resources for
>     further annotations using the RDF technology. On desktops that are not
>     aware of annotations or semantic databases, a way of uniquely
>     identifying
>     resources is also handy, thus it is not required to run RDF
>     applications
>     to use the semdesk URI scheme.
>
>     The scheme is intended to be used by desktop search engines to
>     identify
>     resources from desktop applications. This allows resources to be
>     identified independent of implementation.
>
>     This RFC uses a similar approach to URIs as the HTTP RFC:
>
>        URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to
>     some
>        known base URI [11], depending upon the context of their use.
>     The two
>        forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always
>     begin
>        with a scheme name followed by a colon. For definitive
>     information on
>        URL syntax and semantics, see "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
>        Generic Syntax and Semantics," RFC 2396 [42] (which replaces RFCs
>        1738 [4] and RFC 1808 [11]). This specification adopts the
>        definitions of "URI-reference", "absoluteURI", "relativeURI",
>     "port",
>        "host","abs_path", "rel_path", and "authority" from that
>        specification.
>
>     The elements of a semdesk uri are:
>
>     semdesk://[host]/[application]/[abs_path]
>
>     [host] identifies the desktop computer using the DNS name or the
>     IP address.
>     This part is optional, as most personal computers have changing
>     names and
>     users are not aware of their name, also when users switch their
>     network the
>     IP address or hostname may change (especially with dialup connections)
>     Use the [host] part only when the hostname is a registered DNS
>     name and
>     statically configured for the desktop computer.
>

>     or other
>     delimiters. An Informal registry of application names is hosted at

Hi Mikhail,<br>
<br>
the original question I need feedback on (extended)<br>
* if there is another standardized way to solve this - how does KDE<br>
solve it?<br>
* How did microsoft plan to do it with WinFS? any experience?<br>
* would you like to join the task-force TF-Ont-Id to work on this?
<br>
* Do you think we should develop this as Nepomuk standard or a W3C
standard?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(now the XRI side-track:) <br>
<br>
I think we need a desktop scheme, not a web-scheme, we need a
non-HTTP-BASED uri scheme, because on the desktop you usually don't
have a HTTP service running, and&nbsp; http has some issues when used on the
desktop (arguments below in original post)<br>
<br>
I have looked at XRI last year, while writing "Cool URIs for the
Semantic Web" and I share the opinion of Thompson and Orchard about XRI
(a draft):<br>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/URNsAndRegistries-50">http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/URNsAndRegistries-50</a><br>
<br>
"We have shown that <code>http:</code> identifiers for XRIs can
achieve
the goals of XRI with substation benefits. The XRI goals of persistent
identifiers and location independence are already available with <code>http:</code>
identifiers. There are two concrete benefits to using XRIs identified
in the previous analysis: that users cannot waste time by erroneously
dereferencing namespace names that do not have namespace documents, and
that an extra HTTP GET request is avoided when documents move. The XRI
identifier solution's downsides are adding a new identifier scheme with
the software and human costs and seemingly mandatory increased network
costs ( our example shows 2 HTTP GETs instead of 1). Given these costs
and benefits, deploying a new registrar, resolution mechanism and
related software to layer on top of existing web functionality is not
justified<b>.</b>"<br>
<br>
basically, XRI is adding complexity to HTTP uris.<br>
<br>
And this also counts for most other invented URI schemes, refer to&nbsp;
"URNsAndRegistries-50" for good arguments. <br>
I add a note into the RFC draft in our SVN that we don't use XRI
because of this.<br>
<br>
thanks for the pointers,<br>
this question will pop up again,<br>

Nepomuk, Aperture,<br>
    <br>
On the semantic desktop, we need URIs to identify and locate, and<br>
possibly retrieve RDF information, about every resource on the desktop.<br>
For the "file" uri scheme, this works perfectly, but there are
resources
    <br>
stored in databases, often managed by applications, that are, even using<br>
the dirtiest hacks, not accessible using an existing URI scheme.<br>
    <br>
two examples to illustrate the problem:<br>
* identifying e-mails stored in the desktop e-mail client
    <br>
* identifying contacts, appointments, todos from the local PIM
application<br>
    <br>
although each application may expose a way to identify these resources<br>
uniquely, this is neither standardized nor captured by the <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="file://">file://</a> uri
    <br>
scheme.<br>
    <br>
We have repeatedly tried to come up with hacks to identify desktop<br>
resources, and have discussed this longer [5] but now, given the<br>
pressure of nepomuks standardization effort, we should not continue
with
    <br>
a hack but standardize and recommend our practice[4] in an RFC at IETF
[3].<br>
    <br>
This may seem a big effort, but I think it could be an outcome of our<br>
current work that lasts a little longer. And its concise, the scheme
    <br>
could start with identification, and leaves retrieval and opening the<br>
resource to the operating system.<br>
    <br>
Nepomuk people have asked about desktop URIs, I talked with Antoni about<br>
this for longer, and have been pondering on this since 4 years myself.
    <br>
Its time now to start a broader discussion. Otherwise, we may end up<br>
with a hack that is crappily implemented for nepomuk and does not last.<br>
For this, I have updated the [LocalId] wiki page in the internal
Nepomuk
    <br>
wiki and started writing an example RFC. [2]<br>
    <br>
please give feedback:<br>
* if there is another standardized way to solve this - how does KDE<br>
solve it?<br>
* would you like to join the task-force TF-Ont-Id to work on this?
    <br>
    <br>
Feedback that is not helpful:<br>
* "please use http URIs" - this is not possible, because desktops have<br>
changing DNS names, so the URI will change once you switch network. And<br>
HTTP uris are not retrievable for desktop pcs. Even with the hacks we
    <br>
thought of, it is not clean.<br>
and the HTTP port is not fixed, for each user there may be a different<br>
port. Also,<br>
opening an http server on the desktop may be a security risk in many<br>
environments. And, there is the <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="file://">file://</a> uri scheme
    <br>
standardized by IETF. http is not the silver bullet on the desktop, I<br>
have to admit.<br>
    <br>
I also think that creating this standard within Nepomuk, and later<br>
asking W3C or OASIS to bless it will not work. This discussion should
    <br>
rather be hosted on the W3C semantic web deployment WG in the first<br>
place. This would give the operating system developers and the desktop<br>
search engine people at W3C (apple, microsoft, google are W3 members)<br>
the chance to work on it, and if they work on it, they may even<br>
implement it.<br>
    <br>
With NIE and NRL we have the problem that its "our standard" and<br>
W3C-frenzy people may stick to the vCard/iCal/exif work done by W3C
    <br>
"just because its W3C". So I would rather host this discussion on a<br>
broader level.<br>
    <br>
I am well aware that this is an ugly job and will take a year to get to<br>
somewhere, but - we have a year - and I am really eager to get this
done
    <br>
right.<br>

    <br>
Status of this Memo<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and status of this protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution of this memo is unlimited.<br>
    <br>
Abstract<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This document specifies defines the "semdesk" Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; scheme for desktop resources, used to
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; identify resources on desktop operating systems within RDF.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme is used to identify resources within databases or desktop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; applications, that are not captured by <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="file://">file://</a> ([RFC1738])<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ways to retrieve RDF representations via a desktop resolving
protocol are suggested.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
Introduction<br>
we cannot use RFC1738 because they are not capture there, we cannot use
"info:"<br>
    <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4452.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4452.txt</a>
because they are not to be registered,
    <br>
and we cannot use "urn:" <a
 href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt</a>
because our<br>
identifiers are location dependent.<br>
    <br>
We cannot use HTTP URIs, because desktops have
    <br>
changing DNS names, so the URI will change once you switch network. And<br>
HTTP uris are not retrievable for desktop pcs. Even with the hacks we<br>
thought of, it is not clean. The HTTP port for a desktop may be blocked
    <br>
or multiple users on one machine may collide ports.<br>
Also, opening an http server on the desktop may be a security risk in #<br>
many environments. And, there is the <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="file://">file://</a> uri scheme<br>
standardized by IETF that shows how to do it.
    <br>
http is not the silver bullet on the desktop, I have to admit.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
1. The "semdesk" URI scheme<br>
Semantic Desktop URIs have several parts, including an application
specific part,<br>
hostname information and a path within the application's namespace.
    <br>
The name "semdesk" stems from the requirement to identify resources for<br>
further annotations using the RDF technology. On desktops that are not<br>
aware of annotations or semantic databases, a way of uniquely
identifying
    <br>
resources is also handy, thus it is not required to run RDF applications<br>
to use the semdesk URI scheme.<br>
    <br>
The scheme is intended to be used by desktop search engines to identify<br>
resources from desktop applications. This allows resources to be
    <br>
identified independent of implementation.<br>
    <br>
This RFC uses a similar approach to URIs as the HTTP RFC:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; known base URI [11], depending upon the context of their use. The
two
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; with a scheme name followed by a colon. For definitive information on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; URL syntax and semantics, see "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Generic Syntax and Semantics," RFC 2396 [42] (which replaces RFCs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1738 [4] and RFC 1808 [11]). This specification adopts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; definitions of "URI-reference", "absoluteURI", "relativeURI",
"port",
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "host","abs_path", "rel_path", and "authority" from that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; specification.<br>
    <br>
The elements of a semdesk uri are:<br>
    <br>
semdesk://[host]/[application]/[abs_path]<br>
    <br>
[host] identifies the desktop computer using the DNS name or the IP
address.<br>
This part is optional, as most personal computers have changing names
and<br>
users are not aware of their name, also when users switch their network
the
    <br>
IP address or hostname may change (especially with dialup connections)<br>
Use the [host] part only when the hostname is a registered DNS name and<br>
statically configured for the desktop computer.<br>
    <br>
[application] - a unique string identifying the application that
manages
    <br>
the resource. only alphanumeric characters allowed, no punctuation or
other<br>
delimiters. An Informal registry of application names is hosted at<br>
    <a href="http://www.semanticdesktop.org">http://www.semanticdesktop.org
    </a>. It is possible to use non-standard<br>
application identifiers.<br>
    <br>
registered application identifers are (experimental, under frequent
change):<br>
* kde - items within the K Desktop environment, KAddressBook, etc
    <br>
* msoutlook - resources within microsoft outlook<br>
* email - identifying e-mails within local desktop e-mail clients.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each client has to register at the operating system, one scheme is
used<br>
    <br>
[abs_path] the Path identifies the resource uniquely within the
application.
    <br>
The same restrictions apply as within RFC 2396 and RFC 2616.<br>
    <br>
1.1 Examples<br>
    <br>
For msoutlook:<br>
semdesk:///msoutlook/item/00000000ECD4B99358B9814B9DAFE2255CD8AE9A44B42F00<br>
semdesk:///msoutlook/folder/00000000ECD4B99358B9814B9DAFE2255CD8AE9A44B42F00
    <br>
    <br>
for e-mails:<br>
The emails can either be identified by their message-id, their folder,<br>
or their standardized IMAP URI.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="mailto:semdesk:///email/messageid:23979723@example.com">semdesk:///email/messageid:23979723@example.com
    </a><br>
    <a href="http://semdesk:///email/imap://joe@example.com/INBOX;45">semdesk:///email/imap://joe@example.com/INBOX;45</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
2 Retrieval and opening of resources<br>
    <br>
Operating systems or services running on the OS have to provide ways to
    <br>
retrieve a description of the identified resource.<br>
The retrieval method is similar to HTTP-GET.<br>
We cannot propose a definitive standard, as each operating system has
different<br>
approaches, but the protocol should somehow go like this:
    <br>
    <br>
GET <a href="mailto:semdesk:///email/messageid:23979723@example.com">semdesk:///email/messageid:23979723@example.com</a><br>
accept: application/rdf+xml<br>
    <br>
Implementations use existing protocols (operating system calls, DLLs,
    <br>
DBUS messages, etc) to<br>
provide this functionality, but are platform dependent.<br>
    <br>
An operating system service may implement methods to open resources<br>
identified<br>
using the semdesk URI scheme:<br>
    <br>
START <a href="mailto:semdesk:///email/messageid:23979723@example.com">semdesk:///email/messageid:23979723@example.com</a><br>
    <br>
This call will invoke a desktop application to show the identified<br>
resource to the user<br>
    <br>
